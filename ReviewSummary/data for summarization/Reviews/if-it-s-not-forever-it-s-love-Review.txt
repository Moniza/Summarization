 
                                it's is not worth i thought for it.
i am sure if i got such a chance to write a book i will write with the same title worth for reading.... don't earn only guys, first learn some                            
 
                                Its another trashy campus novel all about fascinations of adventurous sexual encounters over tours supposedly of the author,
in a mundane attempt to keep you reading-bound, he keeps a mystery element of who actually died in a blast he reportedly escaped by a narrow margin, whose diary etc, fails to give the Agatha Christie suspense either.
maintains the novel with a humanitarian touch, ends in a tragic romantic dash, 
but its not about the end, the narrative is what doesnt keep you enthused, or only if you wanted to read where all could you squeeze in with your live-in live-off girlfriend for a quickie, this might be an OK on the scale of its erotica element.                            
 
                                Just one line about the Book...its a very engaging story and a pretty good read. It was a gift to my sis as i had already read the book and want to say something about the delivery....its too awesome!!!.... the Flipkart's official seller 'WS RETAIL' they are the best as they deliver the product well before the given time which i love about them, pls do keep up the good service :)                            
 
                                I have started the book with lots of expectations. Expectations have developed from its title, story line, low cost & discount from flipcart.com and finally reviews read from other readers. Expect Mr. Vanda Pereira Rodrigues, most of the readers praised the story and its author. After completing the book I am absolutely in same view of Mr. Rodrigues.  Though who want to get real feedback of the book please refer his outstanding review.
Finally thanks a lot to flipcart for their quick supply of books with such discounted price and for providing such excellent review platform for us.                            
 
                                Very interesting story line, keeps you wondering what would happen next.. the love stories, road trip part & of course the notes from the DIARY of THE DEAD GUY..

The starting is a little boring but as the story unfolds, it gradually becomes interesting..

The last a few chapters of the book are just awesome with too many twists and turns, one just cannot stop reading this book towards the end..

All in all a good one from Durjoy & Nikita..!! It wouldn't be surprising if any movie is declared based on this book..                            
 
                                Awesome read. One of the best books from Durjoy.
Never felt so much about love and pain. Deb and Avantika at the matured level and at their best phases of life.. Beautifully written. For me, its a tie between this and Till the Last Breath...! Both rock!! 
Loved the book.                             
 
                                Awesome Story, never had a feeling that Love can be so true in today's world. I have read it. Go for it buddies, The one who has loved anyone can only understand the feeling inside the book. Its a true story and its amazing.
Loved the book and Flipkart as usual it was awesome experience..                             
 
                                Not worth it. I wonder how do people call it a novel? I mean, really! NOT AT ALL WORTH IT. Just a time-pass, but surely not a read. I purchased it, but I'm disappointed. Sheer-disappointment! I would NOT recommend this book, never!                            
 
                                If you are thinking to buy it coz of 'high' number of 4 and 5 stars? HOLD ON! And read mine too: This book is sheer wastage of money and time. Only the diary part is better, rest is all CRAP, and such a boring thing. I usually don't read the books by just viewing the rated stars, but this one, was definitely a MISLEAD! DON'T BUY IT! NEVER!                            
 
                                its only the diary part that i liked....climax was bland...everything except the diary is absolute CRAP!!!!Such a waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the reviews are so misleading................................................................................................                            
 
                                I don't know what's the criteria to write in cover page "BEST SELLER". It's a complete waste of time and money. You just turn the page and you'll find sex and nothing else. I don't know what makes this writer write so much about his relationship in his every book. Story is predictable. I'll strongly suggest not to invest your precious time on this.                             
 
                                its a book that will itch your brain. Really. Once you start, u will get bored easily, but still can not leave the book incomplete. It has repetitions of a word, of an incident, and such other things(i guess u knw what)....It will not render you happy...

brownie points: Excellent delivery and packing by flipkart.
                       Durjoy datta is good looking;
                       Nikita Singh is pretty as well.                            
 
                                Cmpleted ths buk in jst 1 day.....its 1st novel dat i cmpleted in jst 1 day....i was so lost in d search of ragini.....d twists n turns were amazing....durjoy sir u r simply awesum......keep it up......:) :) :)                            
 
                                if you have plenty of time,i mean you want to kill time :p ,ofcourse you may buy this book. nice plot and twist are the only good aspect about this book..bad grammar,not so good language,pseudo modernization or rather trying to make characters cool but i personally feel tht attempt was a flop.
buy it only if u badly want to read something and waste your time...                            
 
                                i just purchased this book and once i start reading this it was like ride, how they travel from place to place in search of the men, and in the climax how every thing changes was a bit filmy. But overall it was a great experience.                            
 
                                There is too much to enjoy and learn from dis book....amazing description, incredible presentation n mind blowing concept.....
Dear Author, reading such books of yours makes me feel like falling in love everytym i read them!!!!                            
 
                                I bought this book by paying rs 100 and when I started reading it. eww..while reading this I wanted to throw this book but for the sake of my money I was reading that  I don't know why anybody can like this crap. Author is on adrenaline rush while writing this, delhi blast is just for making it little bit mature but actually it is not mature at all. It is a stupid attempt and totally filmy. I learned one thing from this never buy novels of new Indian writers.                            
 
                                If you're a light reader and read because there's nothing else to do, even then, I wouldn't recommend this book. No poise and a story that makes you feel like you have definitely seen\heard of it before. 


 
                                What will be your last words if you were to die tomorrow?????? ... Awesome is the only word that comes to my mind. The book is an absolute page turner to say.  The end was least expected..

I finished this book in two days flat... Deb, Avantika, Shrey, Tia, Ragini, Ritam, Nigel and Piyush are still fresh in my memory... Great book....                            
 
                                Its been a period when all Indian writers write about college love and lost stories and all appears to be a bit similar.But this one is doing some justice.This book deals with three lovestories to which we can connect and its more for Youth.Its worth your time..Enjoy :)                            
 
                                I read 
fifty shades (all three books) the sex part was okay but later on it becamoe boring. 
In this book there was good sex. Oh yes I am single and journey of two hearts they also have good sex in books but expecting more :D 
That's the need                             
 
                                While I'am no expert at reviewing books,I still think it would be Ok for me to  put my two cents in,simply aimed at highlighting the entertainment this book manages to provide and How. Ignore the bad English, the grammar, even some repeated sideline plots intermingled with the main story..(which is true. Sex ,vivid description of lust, human attraction et al are now kind of trademark of his books)..still the base story of this book keeps one glued to continue reading and engaged. While the authors have tried hard to mingle enough twists and turns to leave the reader reveling in surprise, I would say the end went on to be just too unexpected and I was somewhat disappointed..
Tiya and Shrey as characters are surely going to remind you of someone you know of in your life..to say they are close to reality.In sharp contrast is Deb,the lead protagonist..Err do men like him still exist?:P
Nevertheless,one of the better books by Mr.Dutta...Appy Reading!


 
                                Well the sudden change in story was a good turning point. Good for Indian Reader Point of view. Fun.Enthusiastic! I Think title is apt & Flip kart's delivery was in 2 days and great packaging. If you are a critic you are not gonna like it! :D 
Don't go by the negative comments its an interesting book.                            
 
                                I dont say this was too good or soo .. But i felt from all those typical routines from Durjoy i felt this one was little different ..But it was more like a flimy story .. Imagination is a part of novel but i never like novels which are always imaginative ...                             
 
                                I had completed this book yesterday only and i really found it oring when i 1st started but as soon as i read into d depth i found somewhat interesting in the middle but again atlast i was not much impressed.......
Dont go for it ......                            
 
                                Sometimes I am amazed how novels like this becomes a best seller. There could be because of two reasons: 1) Youngsters relate every college love story as their own. 2) Otherwise, readers haven't read some excellent and beautifully woven titles like The Promise, Choice, Love Story, P.S. I Love You etc. Coming back to this title, nothing new, poor grammar and very predictable storyline. On the lines of Chetan Bhagat's novels, but not even humorous like Five Point Someone, Two States etc.  Don't waste your money on this one.                             
 
                                i just finished this book and i cant tell it is how great,at beginig 10 pages seems to be boring,lately it got si intesting the twists were unexpected and climax is aswome ..."if its not forever..its not love" it just got defined  .........                            
 
                                I read it as the first of my durjoy dutta book and really like it a lot. the plot on which the story is based was very much interesting and keeps you to bind till the end i have not read any of this kind before where there is love and the plus point was that it also have two of its mind blowing twists which will came in the end. And just like the bollywood movies it has the happy ending..
one should read it ..                            
 
                                just one thing...not worth buying or reading!!!
waste of time...
no story at all...dont go by all those nice reviews...its seriously not worth anything!!

flipkart wants me to write 200 words but i cant write anything about this book...


 
                                The moment I read the first few pages, I very well knew what the so called suspense of the book would be. Still I read it, as I thought it might just prove out to be a good romantic novel. But, alas, I was wrong. Add to it the grammatical mistakes; and you know what a waste of time and money it is. I wish that the book was at least edited well.
One star for the cover though.                            
 
                                The story is gud.. infact a very nyc n humble message is there in the buk.. but it would b more informative n more excited to get to know for me.. that How cum this story is come from..is it real or jst inspired rather from some where it cum.. in real from .. where? But if story is real n inspired too from sum where.. DEN people vl show there more interest to read these kind of novel.
& the AUTHORS--HATSS OFF--A VERY GUD NOVEL "IF ITS NOT FOREVER, IT'S NOT LOVE".KEEP IT UP. :)                            
 
                                I found the book very youthful. Apart from this it says that ppl in the age group of teens to twenties do get sensitive & emotional (unlike they are perceived to be) to the situations they go through or see other ppl go through and can relate to their lives, which I have experienced myself in life. It asks ppl to come out of their monotonous lives with 24X7 work schedule, social networking sites, madly partying and such stuff to go out in the real world and experience such things some times. Language relates to the youth & to ppl young at heart and who like to EXPERIMENT with what they read. its short and sweet and not at all predictable. And tells you what real love must be like FOREVER.                              
 
                                I enjoy Durjoy stuff its honest and cool(excpt the kiss novel it was awful)..if you want to read something light and not too much to think its wonderful book..it does hav little stereotypes but sometimes things are so easier that way..
i was in trip so i loved the road trip part and inspired me to go on one too...
d diary can be lame and touching at the same time...
dont think much story will surprise you...enjoy the moment...
beginning was little dill and too repetative so dont judge the book by tht...
I am glad a serious topic was also covered and if it makes any of us wonder its wonderful!!..
characters are quite typical and weird at d sam tym...bt well so are we...
I enjoyed the book..its not somethin special but is something which will make you smile in the end..world is nt such a bad place..:)                            
 
                                awesome book...ordered frm flipkart...nd nw read in just a day! moved a lott..all characters seem to b alive. :)
Nice title, great cover design. I just picked it up reading the title.. It sounds pretty cool..
Firstly, the very theme is new -atleast for me. Finding a diary and chasing down the story all across India, collecting bits of story, wow, its damn exciting..                            
 
                                i Love this  book  so much.. i read  this books partly but when i am  reading  this book i was just thinking  that i am exactly that city where this  guys. Love  the way of your writing.but sometimes this book is gettin me bored. all the people who are involved in this book is so  much  goodly written. i think someone's from the bollywood is making the film from  this book. writer's  every situation reminds  something good or bad that's  so much good.every time the writer describe about his girlfriend that;s also good. at last i am just saying that you have to read this one time or if  you wish than more times.                             
 
                                I don't why we Indians made these people stars who does not worth it.This book is a complete garbage the story goes nowhere and also its not inspiring either.It indeed has a great title but apart from that nothing is interesting in this book.I thought writing is a tough business and it takes some much time to write a book ,to think about the concept and all the other things but these writers I don't know what they were thinking while writing this book.Still it makes me laugh and sad at the same time that this book was in the top ten best seller list.                               
 
                                I just finished reading this book today, I palnted a big kiss to it, yes i fell in love with it....
Love is unconditional, If It's Not Forever. It's Not Love...

Deb and Ritam are the ever best lovers, every girls in the world needs a lover like them.

Thanks to Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh for giving us a lovable fiction, page turner...

Must Read book of love stories... 
If It's Not Forever. It's Not Love.....                            
 
                                I bought this book on flipkart by a friends advise. The story had all the indigents of good one, but the last part is too filmy. And also the super-overemphasis on how Deb is feeling pained/responsible/etc. on Ritam.

Overall a possibility of a good book but not one!!                             
 
                                Good for onetime reading. Those given bad remarks are old fellows I believe. It is a good book and dedicated for good cause too.

But Mr. DD you have not mentioned how that car came from Gandhinagar and  what about that rented bike?                            
 
                                its toooooooooooooo gud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

it was sooooooooo thrilling!!!!!!!!

i read in jus one sitting!!!!!!!!!!!!

awesome work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i can really guess the parts of nikita singh!!!!!!!

lovely wrk...........

read for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


 
                                Guys, I was just roaming around FlipKart when i found this book. I did't know anything regarding the authors of this book. I read some of the reviews and went blindly for it.
This book will give you surprise or simply shock after shock and you'll just live along the characters in it.
Buy it without any further thinking :)

Well this is my first review here and I had to do atleast this much for a fantastic novel. Need not mention anything for the FlipKart delivery quality ;).                            
 
                                How I wish Flipkart had a way to grade the books on parameters other than 'Popular' or 'Bestseller'. Admitted that tastes vary from one individual to another but it seriously casts a pall of gloom over the collective consciousness of the Flipkart reader if such absurdly juvenile trash is tom-tommed as great fiction or whatever! But on the brighter side it sure gives some hope to all those who can write a few words in English to try their hand at writing novels. The story line was contrived and the unnecessarily repetitive sprinkling of four-lettered words, drugs and casual sex is downright nauseating. The effort to imitate Chetan Bhagat style of writing is now being done by all and sundry and it's time they realize not everything suits everyone. The eighty bucks or whatever i spent could have been better utilized if i had bought some 'Chhota Bheem' book instead. This book is even more juvenile! God Bless the future of Indian fiction writing. The one star is for Flipkart not for the book. Wish Flipkart had provisions for negative stars!                            
 
                                The book seems to be quite interesting in the beginning but nevertheless loses its essence in between.The story is written thinking the sensitive audience in mind. catch and good for people who are very sensitive. they may be find it too god. the book stand to be a mediocre not too god.. only one time read..
Durjoy datta needs to come out of the box and need to write some really captivating stories. twist and turns mentioned in the book is quite predifctable and movie masala.. sad but true..                            
 
                                A must read... and something beautiful by durjoy dutta.I havent like his earlier work much..but this one is an exception...One of the best..i ever read..something different from typical Indian.. romantic novels
A must buy for everyone...                            
 
                                One go & the found the book done. The storytelling is flawless. The pace is great. If you are the one from the old world of road trips , u will find it very interesting. There are enough turns to keep u excited. The language is very peppy. overall a good read.                             
 
                                its a good story but if one is looking for academics then don't choose this. 
The story is written in simple language and we can imagine myself in the road trip along with them. 
The Climax is excellent though i didn't like the ending                             
 
                                After completing the book, i reckon that the author has written too much and has written the book to write a book...! . I felt this way because the plot didnt excite me much, just feels like one more book. Though there is twists in the story, you wont be in the hang over of this book for much time.

Bought this book after reading reviews but its not in the class as good as its reviews was neither it is not bad. One Time Read Book!                            
 
                                Not as good as his previous works, but an enjoyable read nevertheless.
But One can not shake off the feeling that with such a promising premise, one could have easily made a much,much better story.I wouldn't mind if it would have expanded to a hundred or more pages extra. A cross country investigative trip filled with adventures and romance-now who wouldn't like that!
I believe a good research, better,mature subject treatment and a deeper, longer storyline would have given an excellent book to such a promising plot.
Durjoy seems to be a very good writer, I'd just urge him to move away a bit from teenage literature and do some serious,researched and authentic writing. I guess he may have a scope of becoming an international level writer. But then, International readers want some substance too.                            
 
                                This story goes in a simple way.Mr.Datta keeps up his good work by delivering these days youngsters thoughts very beautifully.And the suspense and the way it kept me until i finish the book was awesome.Its gr8 book for those who expect thrillers n turn of events                            
 
                                the books are having very important role in my life...i have been searching for this book...but i havent got it...finally i saw this book and ordered the book...withing 2-3 days i got my book...with superb packing....i am impressed...great work                             
 
                                Its okey okey type Book........... I expect something extra-ordinary from this book. Overall book is good, worth reading it. some part of the book is very slow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

some part of story, feels like my own story..... as if i am reading through RD's diary.... 

The charter remind me about my college days in Delhi.                            
 
                                typical durjoy stuff !! the story is nice with lots of twists and turns..but the ending is perfect ! a good read while travelling..
and as always flipkart's service was very good..book was delivered in a perfect condition !                            
 
                                Simply Waoo... so well written... Road Trip n u feel u r amongst dm.. Chemistry n Understanding between Deb n Avantika amazing and Ritam N Ragini wre just iceng on d cake... Looveed d Book.. It makes u love ur luvd ones even more... who 9s if Tomorrow never comes...

                                Before reading this ,something i really hate was reading.

After reading this ,my view of reading completely changed.

If you hate reading ,then just start with this book

Sure ,You will be impressed

An AWESOME ROMANTIC BOOK                            
 
                                A must read book! One of the  best novel I ever read.. If you haven't read it you must buy this book. You will not regret buying it. What I learned from this book is tell the person you love them and how much they mean to you. Don't keep those feelings inside, you never know what tomorrow holds. If it's not forever, it's not love..very true! :)                             
 
                                Nice title with great cover design. I just picked it up reading the title as it sounded cool...

Finding a diary in the blast and chasing down the story was really good and I liked the ending part.The worst thing is talking too much about sex and sex fantasies, DD should understand talking about sex may add a flavor but talking too much really doesn't make sense.                            
 
                                must read, interesting...still not finished but cannot stop myself to write review...love this book and the narration..sometimes i feel like am with these guys on road trip and living .... trying to create pictures of the characters and feeling their feeling what they must have gone through...                            
 
                                I purchased this book after I happened to randomly read the glowing reviews on flipkart from other readers and also since the book was on a discount I figured I wouldn't lose much if it turned out to be a dud.Unfortunately I did lose something buying this book..Precious hours and minutes of my life were wasted reading this trash. I kept trudging on and wading through the endless nonsense hoping it would get better but that moment never came.

Who are these people praising this book to the Heavens? They can't be older than twelve for sure. And even that makes me sad to think that our youngsters find this mindless bloated drivel so laudable.

The writing is horrendously bad and the grammar terrible to the say the least, the writing style is repetitive and juvenile, the story derivative and predictable and the characters are a bunch of wannabe's who try so hard to be 'cool', it is laughable..The 'author/s'( surely we wrote better grade school essays?!) fancies him/herself to be extremely hilarious (That High School sexual humour peppered throughout is torturous) and their dime store pseudo-psychology inspired idea of eternal, heartrending and 'Real Love' is what actually had me laugh out loud.

Please give this book a pass unless you deliberately want to drop a few IQ points.

As for FlipKart, pat on the back for your prompt service as always.Except that I wish you guys had somehow lost this particular joke of a book in transit. 

The only commendable thing about the book is its catchy title so that one star is for that.


 
                                 This is the best one from DD. Best story with great way of narration. I especially loved the book cover. This one is completely different from his usual fantasy stories. I would recommend this to my friends.                            
 
                                the book is about a chase of a dead girl to tell that the guy is dead but they found guy is alive girl is dead and now boy wanna die  and found girl is alive but boy is dead..........
its more a mystery than love story but this doesnt mean love is missing and all this come together to give the classic.
1 love
2 mystery
3 comedy
4 suspense
5 fate
u dont need more reasons to buy it...go on worth the time more than worth the money....                            
 
                                yesterday i just completely the whole book in just one  go. The way the story transforms from a tragic incident to a road trip in search of love found in the diary is simply awesome . The characters Deb , Avantika Tiya are simply mind blowing . While u read u actually feel u are just part of the story . Author has used simple yet powerful, bold  expressions to express his story . i would recommend everyone to be a part of the story .                             
 
                                Hi,
I am not the one who frequently reads Love Stories, but while surfing on FK, I found "If it's not forever, it's not love" and ordered immediately without second thought (another reason is it costs just INR 60)........It was great treat for me for this Weekend...I completed reading this book non-stop in 12 hours (just 30 min break twice for lunch and dinner)and now I think its priceless..it wonderful...its lovely...its amazing...I am sure this will help me to improve my Love Life (my wife is my Love)....Hats off to Ritam !!! God bless him and Ragini and I pray for their long life !!!
Take care Deb, Nikita, Avantika, Shrey and Tiya !!!
and thanks to FK to avail such book in discounted price (there is no comparison between price and content of book) and delivery time of just 1 day !!!
Love you all !!!                            
 
                                The book is gripping and awesome.. The chemistry between Deb and Avantika has always been exciting since the first book. In this book their relation goes through different phase and depicts a supportive Avantika. The book is a great to read and m sure you will wish to fall in love with sumone after you read it...                            
 
                                Why the author is so overindulged with sexual fantasies. A good example of how an over overdose of sex can do to a good story!!!!! I have simply wasted my precious time .Simply total waste.. The author has portrayed today's youth with only one aim , one vision ...                             
 
                                This book shld'nt skip out of any1 sight.. Its really heart-throbing.. You will get combo feeling of realising n replenishing ur thoughts abt ur "love lyf" as well as abt "love of ur lyf"..
While reading this I felt as if my heart was in my mouth n my eyes were out of their sockets...
I was elated after reaching the climax...
Thank u vry much..this is d best book out of the whole lot. :) 


 
                                Even this book is of DD style.So those who loves his style, book is again awesome. But loads of sex is what make you sometimes irritated. Go and grab. It is not even so bad.You will be taken on ride along with the Deb.Will fill that you yourself are exploring things with him.                            
 
                                I was never a 'BIG' fan of his books - but after this one - i turned into one. The only bad part in this book is it gets a tad bit boring somewhere in the middle. A catchy title, an awesome plot and great dialogues.. A book worth buying - and it surely wont disappoint you :)                            
 
                                One of the best ones. True love story. everbody will feel connected with the story is some strange way, after all at some point of time in life everbody falls in love trap. liked the thrill in the end. FanTastiC ENd.                             
 
                                what a story...total durjoy dutta stuff....love the durjoy thinks about every aspect of life..must buy..must read ....must feel..awsome name selected for the book.." if its not forever its not love"..so true...totlay agreed wid it....hats off to durjoy nd nikita singh for a superb vision....keep spreadind it....:)                            
 
                                I didn't want my eyes to get off the book while I was reading it. Great book. Tried his book for the first time, and I appreciate his writing. 
Touched my heart in the end and throughout the book. There was a feeling of eagerness building inside as to what will come next while I was reading it. Great love story. I got to learn many things, thanks to Mr. Durjoy and Ms. Nikita for this. 
Looking forward to some more good stuff. And yeah, I'm gonna read all his collections. Again, I must say, a great book it is.                             
 
                                I really feel disappointed after reading this book, was expecting something better..hope next book will be something better then this durjoy..every thing predictable..there is a lot of repetition of same thing.."i could be the person who died"..                             
 
                                Its a one stretch reading book. Worth buying it. Different from usual Durjoy's Novel. simple, fun, interesting, twist and turn at ending..............
Awesome Love in it....
I love RD, Nivideta, Tiya .........and of course how can i forgot giving review without Deb & Avantika....

I was trapped in the world of Deb & avantika.                            
 
                                The best book you can ever read in your life. Once you start reading the book, it seems as if you are a part of their journey and you just can't keep the book down. Author has really written it fantastically. You can feel each and every word written. You can feel the pain, you can feel the love and it stays with you always then. After all 'If It's Not Forever.It's not Love'.                            
 
                                This book is one of those campus love stories but without the backdrop of a campus but on a road trip from Delhi to Banglore with a burned diary to find a person.But the plot has not one but two lovestories...The book has some subtle messages but i was too matured to read this book ....this book is for very young students..i expected something but it turned out to be somehting....
But chees to the writer he has written a good book considering his young age i dint like it because i was not his target reader..but his target readers will be truely be amused by his writing...those who are looking for pure fun and time pass will surely like this one..                            
 
                                Its always been a wow experience to buy anything from Flipkart,their deliveries are too fast & always before time... In-fact I got this book in a span of 24hrs then the informed time & day. Keep up the good work Flipkart!!! 

I enjoyed reading this book...because it keept me on toe.. the book is really gud one.. and its sure-short worth reading.. dont give a dam miss to it...you can surely go for it.. :)the story in itself doesnt make you loose interest, u go with d flow.... though the last few pages are little tacky.... bt still i enjoyed it .... 

Suggestion to Flipkart, after reading this book i understood that this book is a continuation to the writers previous book. bt it never indicated which one i should go first....  will surely buy the other parts puplished by the author.... bt plz indicate a feature stating the series/ order in which the book are to be read...


 
                                The novel starts off with our hero witnessing and experiencing the gruesome act of a certain category of humans named terrorists. He comes across a diary which has a confession of a passionate lover  .Our hero sets off his journey in search of the girl whom the person in the diary loved more then his life. Its a quite good read,however i felt certain parts to be unnecessarily stretched.Its not the best but neither its intolerable.Writers however manage successfully in portraying the passion of the person in diary towards his lover and at times you really tend to feel bad about him.The plot is interesting but pace is slow , All in all it can be given a try                                 
 
                                I personally did not enjoy reading this book. The sentences are very repetitive and after a while it just gets boring! The plot could have definitely been handled a lot more better

The service by flipkart is superb!! It was delivered the next day itself.                            
 
                                i love how he keeps us engaging with his wild jokes and yet displays each and every character soo beautifully... i loved this book as i m a totallly love story lover.. n the mostawesome part.. he doesnt has to use expert english he just keeps casual way of speaking which is the best thing i liked..                            
 
                                It was fantastic read all the way. The emotions that the author bring through every passing page and the thrill of following the footsteps of a mans' words written down in his diary gives every reader the temptation to turn over every page by every second! Order it and enjoy it until the end. :)                             
 
                                Wonderful book.Read the story in the first go itself.Perfect blends of romance with association with the terror attack and other real life scenarios.Too good.Even thought the main concept of terror is tragic but romance made it really worthier for reading..


 
                                i dunno y durjoy keeps guwwafing bot his gf so mch ..." EVEN THE PHOTOSHOP WILL  PUT TO SHAME " It really sucks man......try 2 wrte sme new stuffs rather than filling pages by writtin bot ur gf...we r nt spendin bucks 2 read bot her ...!!!                            
 
                                I am reading this book and i surprise because i m reading 1st novel of Durjoy Dutta and the character is very good specially tia the 18 year old girl......really good book. And off course the deb girlfriend  avantika she is really good....                            
 
                                Durjoy tried to create some emotions expressing tthree love stories with its twists and turn. The charracters are funny as well as sensible and emotional.The way of expressing the journey was good.They tried to make the stories likable and beleivable to his best.I won't say they have failed to express the overall emotion involved in those stories but somewhere i feel it could have been more better and less boring.The pages from the diaries are too boring as those did not have any conversations involved.Anyways it has got a happy ending with some tears in the midst.A well tried novel. 

I hope to see more from them in future.Cheers :)                            
 
                                Really awesome book.. just felt like keep on reading the book.. interesting twist..great job by the author..                                                                                                                                                                             
 
                                i Wish this story could not be real...!!!
No matter how Deb just bored us with repeatedly narrating about his sex life, i just loved the way he brougth the dairy part... Ritam (the owner of dairy) had only two reasons to survive one s Niveditha (his sis) and the other s RAGINI (His soul), but at the end the way he struggles to accept and realise the fact TAT HE HAD LOST THE REASONS TO LIVE, tears rolled down in ma eyes an made me to feel that I WISH THIS COULD NOT BE REAL...
ONE OF MY FAV BOOK EVER..
I JUST LOVED IT AND LOVED RITHAM TOO...


 
                                superb love story... i have always been a fan of Durjoy Dutta books... this is the best one ever...i read it in one go..cudnt stop reading it till the end...story line is amazing.. Their road trip in search of dead guy’s story is really beautiful..The author has written it so beautifully that you will fall in love with it..it made me feel i was with them in the road trip too finding new clues ...and best of all is the story of dead guy (the dairy) starts wit stars with a beautiful quote.The quuotes are so beautiful that I can’t stop updating it on facebook and forward it as sms..totally loved the book...its a must read for all and esp who are in love...                             
 
                                I was expecting the same old sad love stories. Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl.

But the authors are not up for crap like that. The book is wonderful,touching,sentimental and trust me not at all "cheesy". It has sense and emotions in it..and you'll love it.

A must read..beautifully written and I think the authors have successfully done their job.Wonderful climax must say.

Go on..EXPLORE!!                            
 
                                I bought this book seeing its title and I have no regrets. The story is very gripping and I finished in one go. âIf It's Not Forever. It's Not Love âis a story of Deb who survived the Delhi High Court (Chandni Chowk) blast on the 7th September 2011.He found a half burnt diary of an unknown person who lost his life in the blast. Since initial pages were burnt, Deb could not find name and contact no of the dead person. He read the diary and found that it was a one sided love story of the dead boy. Deb became inquisite and wanted to inform the girl about the immense love. Accompanied by his best friend â Shrey and his fiancÃ© â Avantika he went on road trip in search of the girl. As the search for the "dead guy" continues, the story becomes more and more adventurous and interesting

 There are twist and turns in the story .You will feel that you are travelling with Deb and undergoing the same exhilaration and frustration. All the characters are beautifully portrayed and title is apt. It sents a message that Love is forever and is devoid of lust .Heart touching story with different plots and an unexpected ending .It is a sure to read book.


 
                                It's a crap.Authors have tried a lot to create a suspense or show emotions, but somehow it's not so appealing.Indian authors should really search for a good story and narration.Some pages of the book is too boring and repetitive.                            
 
                                This book is somewaht different from regular love stories. I wont even say it a love story but it definitely shows love between people and their desire to know about others.
This is not a type of book that give you tears and that's what I liked about it.. I would rate this book a 3 out of 5.. Not bad...                            
 
                                This is a great story and makes me believe that no matter what happens in life.....love wins at the end of the day. It also reinstates the fact that "IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE, SET IT FREE; IF IT COMES BACK ITS URS AND IF IT DOESN'T IT WAS NEVER URS"

Great story....thanks Durjoy for sharing!!!!!!!!!!                            
 
                                â âWhen you know that your happiness is
like a sacrificial lamb for the happiness of
the person you care about, you should
realize that youâre in love. The most
incurable form of love!â
the best lines of the novel..even i have marked in my piece.

Its one of the best novel by an Indian author(collectively though)...I am still thinking of the characters,beautifully presented and Dev and Shrey you have justified the love story of Ritam and Ragini.
I like the standard of writing especially by an Indian author and yes i will say it again,ITS ONE OF THE BEST NOVEL..go for it else you will miss it when your friends will discuss the story.                            
 
                                Reading this book will take you through a very awsum journey.
This books contains fun, love and all.
So overall this book I just awsum!
Anyone reading this will just love it.
Its will make one understand meaning of life and how precious is it.

I recommend this book.
One should read this.                            
 
                                Gud mixture of emotions...
A feel gud feeling...
Eyes fill with tears sometimes...
but also
Lips form a curved shape sometimes too...
Great Job by the writer...
a book of younge gen...
love it..:)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .                            
 
                                Great story which tells us how the unexpected incidents made us to think all around and realize how you felt at that time. Good suspense story which tells Love will never go unrecognized if it is TRUE. All the characters are really good in this story. after reading this book you will come to know the essence of True Love...


 
                                This book defines the meaning of true love and makes us realize the importance of our loved ones.It encompasses an amazing road trip filled with love,romance,anger,frustration,suspense,friendship and endless emotions.Deb and Avantika are back,sharing and taking forward their cute love story.Along with them,the other characters are interesting and the main protagonist will surely take your breath away.A great work exhibited by the two bestsellers Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh.
It is a must read book.Grab your copy now if you haven't got it yet:)                            
 
                                at the start of the novel the author finds him self being hint by a bomb blast in delhi...which completely changes his life and his perspective towards it. Altogether the story revolves around a half burnt diary procured by the author at the bomb site, which finally takes the center stage to solving various mysteries regarding the owner of the diary and those in his lives. The characters of the story are chosen judiciously to narrate a touching love story which purely justifies the idea behind the book " true Love Last for ever.." although the book becomes boring at times,which were being covered by the happening in the authors life and his friends.                            
 
                                truly the work of a genius...
must read..
i have read quite a few books but this one is truly amazing..
the author have made sure that the story doesn't takes a dip..
it keeps the reader interested throughout...the chemistry between deb and avantika rocks..


 
                                i must say a awesome book, must read for those who believe in love.....go for it guys u will love the author and its book. true love story.... salute to the writer. u will fall for love again....for sure.....                            
 
                                I liked the book and really loved the way Ritam loves Ragini.
The book has so much of "Making out" stuff which got really boring as it was repetitive and proved lustful,
though i did love Deb and Avantika's love story too. But the diary part was very good.
Tiya was'nt humorous as mentioned in some of the reviews and Shrey was'nt that interesting at all.
But fun loving girls like Tiya who seem immoral and who show an I dont care attitude to the world can be emotional too was potrayed very well by the author.
Overall good book for a one time read and if you are thinking of gifting it to someone special.                            
 
                                An amazing book..and is so beautifully written..
A must must read for all those who like suspense blended with romance..!!!
The authors, Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh have done a great job...HATS OFF TO THEM..!!!                            
 
                                Read the book in one go! Durjoy.. You are awesome.  And after reading your 6th, eagerly waiting for the next. At times, greed is good. Your book made me realise not to hold back..I better tell this guy before its too late. 

Best of luck!!


 
                                "If its not forever its not love"is the best book in my collection of 100 novels
its the best book i have ever read
full of surprizes and a superb mistry
i just couldnt control my tears after reading it
Its a must read                            
 
                                This book is one of the best writings of Durjoy Dutta. His previous books were good but this one is truly heart touching. The way Deb has improvised his style of writings his really fascinating. This time Deb has really written a story which is not just about Sex. Story is a pure heart touching story. At least one time read. Good job Deb!                            
 
                                And the powerful duo of Grapewine India are out with their best work so far. And of course with deb and avantika. The story begins with deb just surviving the chandni chowk blast.He then finds a diary of a true lover....and then his friends (shrey,avantika and a new entrant tiya) to hand the diary to its rightful owner as they proceed they learn quite a lot not only from the adventure they are in but also from each other...this book has definitely set a benchmark for the two authors.
personal suggestion: you love the book if you are romantic at heart.                            
 
                                Dis is de first book of durjoy n i enjoyed it completely!!!!! before i knew i had completed de book in a single sittin.. a very gud romantic novel... shows us wats important in lyf in a very carefree manner .... LUVD IT !!!!                             
 
                                Wow...its fantabulously gud...although i expected it to be gud...but the suspense, poetry and romance created this time by durjoy is really appreciable.
With this book the reader also laugh, cries, falls in love and enjoys life to the fullest 
For all DD fans...a must read novel!!                            
 
                                Bought this book from Flipkart and I have learned my lesson- Never trust the book reviews given in this site. 99% of the reviews given in this site project this book as a good love story with suspense, thrill blah blah. After reading the book, what I felt was that, the author(s) tries to portray lust more than love. Every 10 pages, you can read about Deb and Avantika making out. If Deb and Avantika are tired of making out, then the other couple, Shrey and Tia would gladly take their position. The story is full of logical mistakes. Most probably, the author(s) didn't care to look in to the logical errors while thinking about innovative places to make the characters 'make out'.

I liked the diary part which tries to portray Ritam's true love towards Ragini but then, all sentences seem so familiar( internet is a large database!).

I'd rate it 1/5( I wish Flipkart did have a Negative scale for rating)

Cheers to Team Flipkart for the excellent service.  Keep up the Good work.                              
 
                                The best described way for Love cannot get any better. The step Deb and his friends take are truly to be appreciated, as there are times when get out of words to let someone know how important they are. Sometimes we need to speak up for ourselves to let anyone how special they are.
Definitely Durjoy Datta has completely supported Ritam's story. His love Ragini. An not to mention Nivedita!
There is true love other than what people might take it as Lust.
A true Love Story Best described By Durjoy and Nikita!
Hats Off to you guys!!
That's why this is the fantastically written Love Story. :)                            
 
                                I highly recommend this book for

> Gripping storyline...no where the story seems to drag...and u feel bore. Loved all charcters which played a role in the story
> 3 Love stories with 3 different versions of love...all 3 stories are interwoven into each other
> Not amongst the regular love stories with a tried an tested formula.

                                And this book is super-duper awesome...
Kick-ass story...with suspense, thriller and ofcourse ROMANCE in its every page. :)
Once the book is in your hand, you're not going to keep it away from your eyes untill you've read the last words of last page...I BET!!

Durjoy and Nikita were at their BEST while writting this..
How can anyone miss on such a book??
I didnt, and i think you too shouldn't. :)

sooo...Go Grab It!! :)

                                hi friends

   i m a English literature student and love to read novels and i must tell u it a nicely written novel and emotion will come out when u ll read it must say that Mr. Datta has done a grate work 

At the end i ll suggest u that for a change if u ll read this book u ll love it must buy......                             
 
                                Like many others me too was impressed with the title which is no doubt very very interesting. But as I reach the written matter inside, there was nothing but just MAKING OUT. I tried to push myself to read further but in vain, there was few diary pages which were written nicely and I doubt they have been picked up from some other hit book. And this writer seems so much obsessed with his beautiful Girlfriend that he very soon leave the main storyline and Find himself Making out with his extremely beautiful Girlfriend. 

This book have been a total waste of money, the only thing which I learnt from this book that I am not going to waste my hard earned money and precious time reading any of DD's books.

Total waste of your time & money, It's a sick book.                            
 
                                When I started this book, I had no clue that this would be an adventurous ride to a love story. 
Even though I have long working hours, I finished this book in 4 days. I couldn't keep myself away from it long, so even when I was commuting in buses.. I had this with me..
Thoroughly loved it and was pleased to know that Ritam kinda guys do exist.. I say so cause I too had a love story and m married to the one I love.. and my husband somehow resembles Ritam.. :)                            
 
                                The story is about deb who finds a half burnt diary in delhi blast  written by someone who died on that fateful day.After reading the diary he feels a sense of responsibility towards the dead man.So to put together the pieces of dead man's love story,he decides to go on road trip with his friend Shrey and girlfriend Avantika.
The book has the maddening Deb-Avantika chemistry, definitely freaking Shrey and to top it all â Tiya â as crazy as the other three, if not more. It is a roller-coaster ride or should I say a âtripâ. There is an amazing air of spontaneity and candidness in the story and the characters as well. It has the classic youthful and unsaid love affair between Ritam â the man who is dead â and Ragini the love of this life.
To sum up it has Great dialogue, Great quotes, Lots of funny moments, Perfect twists and turns.
I must say its a true and eternal love story.Just loved it.Kudos to both the authors.                            
 
                                This is the bestest book I've ever read in my life.. I love the way Durjoy justified the characters in this. I had tears in my eyes while reading the book. 
Everyone who is reading this review do read this book. 
Cheers!!                            
 
                                i guess i shud bow down to u guys
Nikita Singh , Durjoy Datta
u brought tears in my eyes........it neva happend before..ughhh... the last few chapters brought tears in my eyes.....

no other book...lyk more than 60 that i have read...cudnt do this...nt even i too had a love story....bt ur's did...cud neva frgt the feeling...
awesome....speechless.....n etc etc..i wud ran outta adjectives for this book...
al ur books were awesome..bt this was the showstopper...
*bows down*
thank you for the book.....                            
 
                                Book is just awesome, couldn't get out of the story.This is the second novel of my life other is two state n it is much better than that.
Kudos to Durjoy  waiting for his another release.Must read book.............................:)                            
 
                                No humor, no way with words, its just a h*rny guy's narration of how many places he has had s*x with, and its somehow love . I didn't really care to finish the book and will return it if i can. Its similar to other books by unknown indian authors. There's no beauty to way they write about their lives, no surprise in the characters. its all commonplace, you can relate to characters because they are typical. And I'm tired of s*x and its mentions used to thrill and add excitement to the novel like I'm some dumb reader who will get excited with sexcapades. I thought this was a modern urban book for an urban audience. Disappointment. 

Weak main character was the biggest flaw.                             
 
                                full Bakwass. No compare with chetan bhagat or with ravinder singh(I too had a love story. The book can be writtten much better if the author had focussed over ragini.......... than to tiya or avantika.                            
 
                                This is by far,the best book written by the man. Its simply mindblowing,be it the dead guy's character(I share his name though,Yipee!!!) or Shrey's final stability in the meetings with the people from the Times of India(read the book for understanding it) or the revival of the awesome Deb-Avantika romance. Its a must read,guys(and girls). Forget about all the other contemporary writers,grab this one ASAP. Adios!!!                            
 
                                Just a few words as i am not a man of words..

If It's Not Forever.It's Not Love read this heartmelting love story no sorry love stories in a single go..The flow in which the story travels was excellent..also the suspense was manitained throughout the story whick will keep the readers engaged to the story. To be frank i was in tears while reading the last part of the story no no last part of a superb love

Hatz off Durjoy for this excellent work..                            
 
                                If its not forever its not love has the most anticipated ending that I have ever read in any novel.One can feel in the what actually true love is.In the I feel like hugging Rd ritham dey.I will definitely recomend you buy this one.I like it and hopefully you will to...;)                            
 
                                I just loved the story.. the way it started and the end was great. In my opinion one of the best work by Durjoy .. just love your writing style..

So many times I was tempted to read the end but somehow I resisted. 

Overall a must read ...                            
 
                                This s d 1st book i started reading in my college life time... wow what a love it s...don miss ur chance of reading it.. ll be surprised ... just read it:) it makes u to live in a imaginary world of those characters coming in the story...                            
 
                                Best of all Durjoy's books.Even though there are some grammitical errors,it wont spoil the feel in it.I recommend it to read. You can read it in a single go. Congos champ. Waiting for your next one. Get your copy soon                            
 
                                Amazing Book...Amazing Stroy...Best Book of Durjoy so far..Loved every single part of it...Tittle truely fits the story..! Awesome...cant get enough adjectives to praise what book is! Way to go DD!! :)                            
 
                                It is definitely one of the best book by the author. The writing is easy.The author has done a pretty good job in conveying the emotions.Every character described has their role properly etched out.I fell in love with the characters and has learnt " If its not forever...its not love". The book has made me love "jerry" a lot more than what i used to..Thanks for writing such a wonderful book                            
 
                                It is said that one should not judge the book by its cover. But this is not at all true with regards to IF ITS NOT FOREVER ITS NOT LOVE.  Just like the cover of the book, the content is also very interesting and soul soothing...

The story revolves around Deb, Awantika, shrey, tiya and the protagonist "Diary" of the Dead Guy. As the search for the "dead guy" continues, the story becomes more and more adventurous and interesting. The constant thought of "what will happen next" keeps you glued to the book.  

In todayâs world when itâs almost impossible to find true love, this book is a treat for all the diehard romantics. Itâs all about love in its most pure and divine form.

Once you start reading this book, I bet you wonât be able to stop yourself from indulging into Durjoyâs and Nikitaâs magical journey of IF ITS NOT FOREVER ITS NOT LOVE 

Just flipkart it guys... its worth reading :)                            
 
                                I am thrilled to read this book.  I would like to salute the authors of this book. It's really amazing experience for me as when i was reading the book I felt myself in it.

Honestly, I ordered this book half heartily just thought to give a chance but I am amazed and happy with my decision now ;).

All the characters are cute and loving. I just loved all of them especially Deb, Avantika and Ritam :)

I advice everyone to plssssssssss give it a try and u will not regret!!! 

Great job!!                            
 
                                This book is undoubtedly one of the best from Durjoy. The way the story has been run in parallel with a parts of another story is awesome. The portrayal of characters, the emotions, everything was so good.

The best and most ecstatic moment was when I read that last line of page 202. Don't read it straight away. Enjoy the journey to that line...

Thanks for such a wonderful book and the fast delivery by Flipkart.                            
 
                                Awesome!!! I loved it....this is among the bst books i hav ever read....it got evrything.. all emotions most important "Love" and tht too pure & true luv...it is excellent...i am in luv vid all four of the characters specially "Deb" & "Avantika".....i also liked the way "Tiya" has been presented...it was really exciting to read a roadtrip journey with all the fun & humour along with a serious luv story. Finally Durjoy Datta & Nikita Singh u guys have written it soo well tht i m in short of words to express wat i feel...:) :)                             
 
                                I got this book with Author signed Copy..and the book was awesome:)in the back page it written If you die tomorrow.what your last words be?? it made me think before reading the book.

Ok..i don't reveal the story because you must read this book.Why stopping..Go and buy:)                            
 
                                I had read the first few pages posted by Durjoy on Facebook and was sure that this book ought to be a different from earlier Durjoy books..I was not let down as i got the book and went through the pages.I could live the incidents on my own,i could feel the pain,curiosity,agony,mystery and the hunger to know more made me finish it within a couple of hours.The climax was really interesting and out of imagination.I just felt that Durjoy as an author has shown real maturity in choosing his words ,describing the incidents and tried his best to convey the message from a victim's point of view.However his love making scenes and certain use of sentences did remind me of his earlier books..Its like every author has their own trademark and so does Durjoy with his Boasting attitude of his manhood..The books also has sequences where one could really feel like himself and laugh out all of a sudden thinking of themselves on the situation.
All in all.Great work and the start of a new dimension for Duroy Dutta the author..Just grab it and have a start and i am sure you would not stop till it ends..                            
 
                                I really liked the book...its fast, fresh and interesting. The road trips, twist and turns are all fabulous :-) Durjoy's previous novels have given me a good reading experience but this book stands apart. The book was dragged a little at few places but apart from that all good. this time not not deb and avantika but shery and tiya and ritam ragini made a good love couple story... In short and precise words... the novel is interesting and fun to read:-)                             
 
                                âIf Itâs Not Forever ...Itâs Not Love!â is a splendid love story by Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh. I have read some love stories but this one just took my heart. This is one of the best novel by Durjoy Datta. Absolutely different from the previous ones.

It was a complete new experience, the true and eternal love was never visible this way. I couldn't put myself off with the book during my exams time :P (hehehe).

The Delhi(Chandni Chowk High Court) blasts were very tragic and painful . Many lost their lives, some were alive but near to death, but our hero Deb was a lucky one. With Avantika, Shrey and Tiya's support they continue their journey to reach the end of the mysterious diary.

A definite recommendation to all ~ to know the true definition of love, to understand love more clearly and beautifully, to understand its purity and importance in life..

Express love and your feelings before it get late..

Last but not the least "If Itâs Not Love ...Itâs Not Durjoy Dutta!"                            
 
                                If its not forever.. its not love was my first "Durjoy" book n the experience was great.. the book is interesting,simple,funny,romantic,tragic(bomb blast) and includes everything that makes it "PERFECT"!!! the book clearly reflects d idea- live life and dont take ur dear ones for granted!!  if you not gonna read it you r missing smthng......                            
 
                                Ordered the book 2 day ago...got it today....
Once i started reading i couldn't stop till i finished it...
it is really good..The story flow is great...
This is truly worth the time of reading...
Enjoyed it thoroughly and if you haven't read any of DD's books till now then its a great book to start with                            
 
                                I have read many good and bad novels n this was way above good,plus this was by far the most romantic novel with the most thrilling n spine chilling ending i have ever read!!!!!!
i bow to the author...                            
 
                                A poorly written book which starts well but all of a sudden takes you away from a sensitive theme to porn. I stopped reading this after a few pages. I was so engrossed with the book till the pornographic details og Avantika did not start. A sensitive theme handled poorly.                            
 
                                Just like "Sun rises in the east and sets in the west", "The Earth moves round the Sun" are accepted and well-established facts... "Durjoy Datta's novels are born bestsellers" has been well-established too..

But then this book offers something more. The passion with which it has been written, the emotional turmoil that runs through the pages, the writings of the diary which brings a smile and at the very next moment makes a drop of tear trickle down your face, everything from the first word of the first page to the last word of the last page keeps you just spellbound as you explore the journey. I've already read the book thrice and not once during my second and third read did I feel bored. A book worth giving many sessions, a book to treasure for a lifetime, a journey which hasn't been witnessed before, a kind of book which can't be matched by any other in the near future...

Hat's off to Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh for pulling off a masterpiece and thus raising the bar so high for a book to be certified as a treasured item that the bar can't be crossed by any one else but Durjoy and Nikita themselves..

Love you both... Expecting more such masterpieces in future...                            
 
                                The moment I started reading this book, I got so involved in the story that it became impossible for me to stop reading the book. It is very well crafted, you actually feel like you are a part of the story and you can't wait to finish the book! It is fabulous..I had pre-ordered this book..and I am glad I did!

I can't wait to read the next one!                            
 
                                When i started to read i thought it will get boring as i proceed..but page by page it just turned out to be an amazing road trip along with the author. I couldnt keep the book especially when the climax came near. It was jus superb. Keep up the good job. M sure peoplewho will read it will learn alot of things..                            
 
                                This book is yet another mind-blowing work of Durjoy, which was supported remarkably by Nikita...
Its the type of book one would like to read over and over again, and still feel greater urge for satiation...

Great work Durjoy and Nikita... Keep it up! Looking forward eagerly for more of your masterpieces... :)                            
 
                                It has Deb and Avantika but it's not just about them. The author quite wonderfully combined the events with the diary. The notes in the diary are quite captivating.
Durjoy does it yet again..Yet Another National Bestseller, I hope !!


 
                                wen i got my signed copy i was like not existing for anyone else... i was in my own world with the superb and tragic lovestory  wen i began with the first page i felt anything can happen to anyone at any time and we have to be ready for every situation.

deb and avantika whom i always admire has done a fab work ...debs love and care for avantika just awesome

                                The book has got all the emotions which has to bee in a book. I had completely gone into book while reading this. It took my deep into love. Seriously If it's not forever it's not Love. I had imagined my love in every scene spent with Avanthika. Durjoy's writing skills where improved from his previous books..it is one which can clearly see in this book. The one word i can see is Much Improved.                            
 
                                If it's not forever, it's not love...

Nice title, great cover design. I just picked it up reading the title.. It sounds pretty cool..

The story was pretty good.. Not like anything expected from Durjoy... I started liking his stories now..

Firstly, the very theme is new -atleast for me. Finding a diary and chasing down the story all across India, collecting bits of story, wow, its da*n exciting..

Hmmm... there is not much which i could explain, just read it once, it is worth a read..

And coming to flipkart delivery, it is excellent as always!!                            
 
                                since from my childhood this is a second book which i read completely(first page to last). Beautiful story...which includes love, romance, sentiment...etc. I completed this book with in two days...i am not able to divert my mind from this book...

While reading this book:

I feel this story is going around me...
I feel romance
I cried at one moment while reading this book
I feel what love is

Finaly thanks alot to Deb, Avanthika, Shrey, Tiya & Ritham & Ragini...I love you all

And Finally Flipkart...Delivery is awesome...with in one day this book reached to me...GREAT Service of Flipkart.

Thanks & Regards

                                What a Novel... jitni tariff karo kam hai... once u start reading dis u wd forget d outside world. U would b in Dev,Avantika,Shrey n Tia's world.

All d characters are very well executed. Its a powerful story dat holds ur interesr till d end. i dint find any part f d story boring or loose. Every bit was just so perfect. 
Durjoy n Nikita did justice to RAGINI n RD... 

FOr dose who havent ordered d book yet... plz plz plz Go ahead!

i guarantee u its worth Reading... :)                            
 
                                This is a wonderful piece of lovely Journey of Love and pain. This one is a winner. The characters are well said and beautifully written, although you have confusion somewhere in the middle on why its happening you will get the answer in the End. 
This one is not a nail biting book but a book with a calm attitude which brings a happy Storm                            
 
                                 I liked the starting chapter when it was on the internet and placed an order for this book.Liked Flipkart service. Congo on it
 I was bit intrigued with its pace at start but things start taking their time. excellent work by both the authors.Sustain the start and the end is the best I ever read. 
 I would have had a disappointing feeling had the end not been so splendid. The last few pages are really really great. A sudden twist in the tale(Though, I suspected RD's death right from the start, i didn't think of the exact possibility) and it justifies its title in the best way possible. would have been only 3 or 4 at the most without the final chapter but the final thing justifies it with 5.
P.S. If you are from Andhra Pradesh, I think this story is bit replica of the local movie 'Sivamani'. :D

                                'I wish I could see her tomorrow'

This sentence after every statement in that diary sent chills down my spine till I reached the end. The story is off the hook & u cant concentrate on anything else while you are reading it. I finished it in less than 4 hours & I want to read it again. Kudos Durjoy. Waiting for your next novel.                             
 
                                Started reading the book after reading all of Durjoy's books and couldn't stop reading it till I gulped it all down in one sitting.. Nikita & Durjoy have done it again.. Its an exciting tale of romance, self revelations, emotions & most importantly  all-out & undying love. It tells us about true & pure love sailing out of all the deep waters, amongst all the mishaps that happen in our lives..
All-in-All an EXHILARATING TALE OF LOVE..

                                Firstly, the theme, is so darn interesting, that you'd be attracted to the cover page itself (like me) :P
I was so desperate, cos I've always received books through flipkart normally within 2-3 days , but this took 7 goddamn days to reach me. And the moment I reached *OMG! I am In love with Durjoy, so I completed within a matter of 3 hours!*

A book so romantic , so lovable and so very beautiful is hard to find ... This book from DURJOY DATTA and NIKITA SINGH will just stay close to your heart forever .... I mean itÃ¢ÂÂs really hard to find any flaws with this one because its soo beautifully written that by the end of it you just wonder WHAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED TO YOU? Or DID IT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU ?

Brought tears to my eyes!

Through this book the authors DURJOY DATTA and NIKITA SINGH have done a commendable job ...have set an extremely high bench mark not just for themselves but for possibly every other Indian author ....

Good luck Durjoy & Nikita!

                                A book so romantic , so lovable and so very beautiful is hard to find ... This book from DURJOY DATTA and NIKITA SINGH  will just stay close to your heart forever .... I mean itâs really hard to find any flaws with this one because its soo beautifully written that by the end of it you just wonder WHAT IF THIS HAD HAPPENED TO YOU? Or DID IT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU ? Set in the backdrop of the most gruesome blast that rips Delhi apart, the main protagonist Deb who was eye witness to it.... the aftereffect of the blast on him , a half burnt diary he encounters with ,his best buddy Shrey and the girlfriend tiya and  of course Avantika .... How can someone miss that.....? Other than the half burnt and its love story.... a few vital characters who make a quick entry and exit and others who stay till the end..... Every aspect of this book has been so perfectly crafted ... so intricately created that one can just not keep the book down until you reach the end and even after the end ... something tingles inside you for a very long time.

The character sketch of every individual character in this book is soo very amazing particularly that of tiya .... With ever new page of this book you will come across a new emotion, a new feeling and learn an altogether new meaning of love.... Trust me on this you will.... While reading the book you will even have embarked upon journey with Deb and his friends and by the end you will possibly realize the real meaning of love.

Through this book the authors DURJOY DATTA and NIKITA SINGH have done a commendable job ...have set an extremely high bench mark not just for themselves but for possibly every other Indian author .... Their writing style is so good that you will stay glued to the book to the very end no matter and in the end you will experience mixed emotions for sure.. This one from the Grapevine India is a MUST READ missing out on this one means out on a lot ... ABSOLUTELY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ROMANTIC BOOK EVER.... A SURE SHOT READ.... HARD TO MISS!!


 
                                I have read and own all the Durjoy books... Among all his books, I feel he has reached his potential now only. I thought of reading it in a few days of prep holidays I had, but ended up finishing the whole book in one go. It was so interesting, I just dint feel like putting it down. Its a must buy for those who enjoy a detour from usual novels which involve "LOVE"... It is a book of its own kind...                            
 
                                bad book with mix and match.................................................................flipkart service is 2gud.not original  written book......grow up durjoy..............................................................................................................................................................                            
 
                                Awesome book , i read it in one sitting..nice characterisation of tiya..kudos to durjoy for securing another success as an author..
as the book was approaching climax i was very much tensed on what was gonna happen and my assumptions were reaching a high count..
speaking of romance ---the book did not have that many but the one liners of love by characters were heart touching                            
 
                                Finished reading if its not forever....today.Felt it was the best amonst the six books.Very touching story.the way you potrayed the characters & the way ths story is said is really commendable.Keep writing & amazing all your readers.All the best!!

 
                                This book is awesome. The lines the flow all amazing.
no word can describe the feeling the heart touch.It's amazing journey of indian man.
Thanks Durjoy n nikita for this amazing book it's incredibly awesone.                             
 
                                It didn't come the way I expected it to. I had thought it would be just like another love story with some twist and turns. But I was so wrong! At the first,it really didn't catch much attention but slowly and slowly,RD aka the 'dead guy' and his flawless and heart-touching lines made meh glued to the novel until the last letter of it. How can some guy love a gal..like,this much? Its like he's worshiping some god and as we all know,it never comes to our mind to find any faults in them. The same way,Ragini was his god. And Deb,Avantika,Shrey and Tiya added the punch wherever it needed. Physical intimacy and love was never described so well till I came across this piece. It made meh cry,laugh,curse,get scared,feel pity,get angry,feel helpless..everything! Till today,I never ever realized that how much I love my girl. She means the world to meh but still,there was something missing always. I didn't always say her 'I love you' because I knew I always do. But the spark I saw in her face when I told her so,that's what makes my day! Thank you Durjoy and Nikita...thanks a tonne..for making us fall in love..once again! :)                            
 
                                Havent laid your hands on this book...??? 

High time folks..!! 
Romance in every page, this book is a wonderful journey. If it's not forever, it's not love is one of Durjoy's best books as I would rate after his first, "Of Course I love You." For me it activated my tear glands for the 7 hours I read the book. (I don't remember the last time my tear glands worked! But the author succeeded in a matter of a book). 

A book to remind all to value true love. If its love you need to tell it when its happening. There is no right time to it! You may never know when death can snatch you from this world. The pages about the dead man's love and his diary would keep you glued to the book wishing to be loved so hard. Believe me I skipped lunch to keep the flow going! why did a man like him have to die in the Delhi High Court (Chandni Chowk) blast on the 7th September 2011? But the best part of his death would be when  Deb comes across his diary in his visit to the site of the blast. Though Deb was there at the place during the blast, he was not affected physically by it. Mentally it sure did pull him down. It disturbs him for days and the sight of the blast flashes in front of him many a times.

His only objective ever since the day he found the half burnt diary was to hand it over to the owners family members or friends. But how does he do it without any address or contact number? With absolutely no thoughts of giving up and with the support of Shrey and Avantika he begins his journey. 

A journey I would personally love to be a part of. Made me laugh and cry all through the pages. A perfect combination of good and bad. A perfect piece of everything.. So apt! If it's not forever... It's not Love!

An amazing effort by the authors! A salute would be too little to express the work put in! A must-read book by all.

Order/Grab your copies asap...!!!! don't miss out on one of the best books ever written and the world has provided you with!

                                it was just amazing.. i mean it tells u that life is so unpredictable.. u never know what will happen tomorrow.. so if u luv sumone just tell him today.. its better to appreciate what u have before time forces u to appreciate what u had... this book touches your soul.. u feel urself in their journey too.. u have tears in ur eyers throughout the book, sumtimes tears of sadness, sumtimes tears of happiness.. it is best book of durjoy among all his books.. also it tells u that luv never gets old.. it always have that spark which u felt initially.. u just need to feel that.. and there is no harm in being immature, irresponsible and stupid in love...

                                I am really touched by this novel. It is well narrated by Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh. It will definitely make a change. I second them for this. This one different from the previous one and i loved it too. When i was reading it...it was like i too had join Deb on his road trip. Awesome !!                            
 
                                hey just finished ur book "If its not forever... its not love".... believe me iam just speechless... i mean heads off to u boss... it was amazing... i had tears in my eyes by the time i finished that book... i think this was ur best book among all of urs... just luved the road journey of deb, avantika, shrey n tiya... initially i thought that this will be a sad ending but happy to read about the forever luv n togetherness of ritam n ragini...
just luv ur books durjoy... keep writing....for us...


 
                                Hey Durjoy, this one is your best till date.... i enjoyed it alot... felt all the emotions while reading and honestly speaking this book came as a surprise from you as i was expecting only a love story from you but it involves a lot of stuff... keep up the good work and now again waiting for your next.... Take care n keep writing :)                             
 
                                I haven't ever misspelt "Reboot" till today when I ended up trying to reboot my machine by typing "Ritam"...It was spooky man!!! Absolutely fantastic piece of writing dude....The flow of emotions and the unpredictabilities really made my day...Thanks sooo much for this awesome tribute to "Love"...and agreed that "If its not forever its not love"...Toooo gooodd!!!                            
 
                                "If it's not forever..It's not love" is a journey;a classic plot for a movie.
The first 50 pages don't usually get the grip.But after that,it's a ride.And what a ride it is!
The beautifully put moments,the characters and twists which bump into your heart engulf you from within.
Enjoy the book.It's a nice read.                            
 
                                Finally a book which is not too fast pace by durjoy`s standards. his earlier candy floss romance books used to be such a fast read...this one takes time as u read , comprehend whats happening and the story starts to sink in slowly..
i can surely say that this one is a book version of Zindagi na milegi dobara....with a mission- to find someone and come in contact with the various persons in his life.. Love is just awesome and it shows- whether its ritam and ragini, ritam and nivedita or even deb and avantika for that matter..Lucky are those who can tell the other person how much they love him/her while they are still there. Fasten your seat belts as this story will take you through tons of emotions you have never witnessed before...                             
 
                                6 hours...dats all dat took me 2 complete dis book..i have been a been fan of dd n i thank him cos every time after reading his books,my 6 year old relationship has taken a new high...but but but,dis time i dint get dat kick while reading d book..the event wich take place in d book becum pretty obvious n it was like,"i knew dis will happen kinds"..it reminded me of novels by ravinder singh i.e. "i too had a love story" and "can love happen twice?"..i think dd is best at the college stuff and all...though 1 thing i would like 2 clear dat after reading every novel of his,i feel dat dis can make a big n successful bollywood movie..dat was all my personal opinion n pls dont form any opinion abt dis book by reading my review..1st read it and den think abt my review...best of luck durjoy n m still a big big fan of urs..                            
 
                                if you like his previous work, you'l find this one awesome :)
its got everything from romance, drama, passion, fear.. everything. its a fun read, especially if you're travelling in a train.. you'l relate well if you've been on a road trip with friends :)                            
 
                                the best book written by durjoy datta after his first 5 novels.his trademark characters deb and avantika continue in this book where they along with their best friend shrey go on a road trip to solve the mistery of a diary that deb found on the september 7 2011 blast site of delhi. They go on a crazy trip without knowing where they would end up and believe me you will feel to be a part of their journey..mostly i loved the unconditional love which the man who wrote the diary has for his girl..that was simply touching. Every man who is in love or who wants to experience the depth of true love should read this..i need not say much about nikita singh. A young author,she has turned out be lucky for durjoy..i am sure she has some magic and she still has a long way to go. I loved the portrayal of girl in the diary,avantika and tiya. Those female characters simply show the different faces of women and definitely its a worth a read to young girls who are turning out confused in relationships..i think they have to learn from these characters not to messr up their life..after all if its not forever its not love..                               
 
                                It is a average read With Extremely good concept. But you might find some Characters begging for sympathy for the sake of making the novel interesting. RD's character is too good to be true. Best Part of this book is The Title itself "If its not forever Its not love.
Peace Out                            
 
                                Its tough, if im going to compare this books with the others Durjoy datta has written, BUT this one is quite unique (like the rest) and its in-your-face fiction. It will keep you thinking even after your done reading it. I always thought only Nicholas Sparks could do that BUT now Durjoy Datta is "The Nicholas Spark" when it comes to Indian Fiction!

Hats off to you, Buddy!                            
 
                                I finished the book in 1 go i could not keep it down for even a second.. and i must say i misssed deb and avantika...they are soo good together.. I mean his books are best when they have deb and avantika in them... i sooo love the book...
its awesomest...
somehow it feels like my own story..as if i am reading through RD's diary and finding his whereabouts..
probably its the connect with the characters....
