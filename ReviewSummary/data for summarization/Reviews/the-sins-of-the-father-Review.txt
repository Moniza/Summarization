                                Where the story ends in 'Only time will tell' I expected a lot from 'The sins of the Father' but somewhere in detailing every thing the pace of story become too slow. Not that good 1. but atleast you can enjoy Archer story telling.                            

                                Read it with huge anticipation after "Only time will tell" and must say...wasn't disappointing one bit..The clifton chronicles continues at good pace in the unmistakable Archer style & keeps you intrigued till the very end..great characters..built brilliantly & every character's story blends so easily in completing the big picture. Can't wait to get my hands on the final installment..Go ahead..Read it without a second thought..
Good service from flipkart..great packing..keep it up...!!!                             

                                Bought this title as I am a keen buyer of the works of Jefrey Archer. But the plot doesn’t hold one's interests and as a result just is a flip of pages. Good if you are travelling somewhere else go for something else.                            

                                A great book by Jeffery Archer.

This book continues the first part of the story this book is a gripping read and it also continues the saga.

The book is very good and the book is totally UNPUTDOWNABLE.

Thus i would tell every reader not to miss this book and read it .


                                I just love those family sagas. And the Clifton Chronicles are excellent. Jeffrey Archer didnt disappoint me. Having said that, you cant just read one.... its like a soap opera... you just have to read the next one as well - Best Kept Secret.

Flipkart as usual is amazing with their delivery time & packing                            

                                the book has revealed the human nature and his tendency archer has done a splendid job in bringing out the characters.
the fight for harry's freedom was depicted greatly  
awesome was the story line waiting for the third part                              

                                Quite a fascinating book. When I bought the book, I thought that the two part book is of different stories. so when I finished one book, I was dumbstruck at the abrupt end but on taking up the second one, I was fascinated by the storytelling prowess of Jeffrey Archer. Very fast and very well conceived story line, straddling the life of Harry Clifton. The intrigue and the wait of how the Author will solve the imbroglio is superb.                             

                                I fell in love with archer's book the moment I read his first book and this series is just one of his amazing works....... and its a SIN to make us wait so long for the other books in d series........................................                            

                                Archer at his best again.

If you have not read the first book, "Only Time will tell", then read that first and then read the other book. 

I had found from experience that many good novelists bring out below standard books after they become  famous and sells millions of books just because of the name. To name a few, Harold Robbins, Sidney Sheldon, even Jeffery Archer. Their first many books are a class apart but then it slips. They try to sell on the name only.

But this time Archer is back to his old style and class. May be not exactly the old class, but close, very close. 

If you were ever an Archer fan, definitely buy and read.

If you are starting Archer for the first time, I would suggest read his earlier books first. In that case may I remind Jeffery Archer has no competition when it comes to short stories. (Many compilations of his short stories are available now)                             

                                The Novel u just got to read it but i would suggest you to read the starting sequence"Only Time Will Tell " before u start reading this. ". As per the plot twists its not to the expectation that one expect from Jeffrey Archer. After reading to end i find that there may be chance for another sequence if the writer wants to cause it leave kind of incomplete, or may be the writer just wanted to leave it that way leaving it to the imagination of the reader.                              

                                Archer proves yet again why he is a master story teller, however if i may say the prequel scores over the sequel. 

The book is fast in the first 200 odd pages it moves rapidly plot by plot.

Interesting thing is how Sir Archer switches across plots and characters and weaves them together. However i would say that this is definitely not in the top percentile works by him.                            

                                This second book of the Clifton Chronicles is very tempting to read. The story goes really smooth and makes you stick with the book until you finish. Flipkart service amazing, especially it provides with the option for choosing from different Printing press. So you dont have to compromise on price or quality.                            

                                1.Print Quality- 5/5

 above average quality paperback.feels nice to hold. letters are neatly arranged..gives a pleasant read.

2. Proof Reading- 4/5

 has some spelling errors and repetition of words..

3. Story - 5/5

 The author does his job very well

 I must say its one of the best sagas I ever read. the first book " only time will tell " took me more than 6 months for me complete. at the beginning when I started to read , it felt quiet boring and i left it there and dint bother to touch it for couple of months. but when I started to read it again and reached at the core, I wasn't able to put the book down without completing it, and did it with a single sitting.

never thought the early 90's would be so much exciting, before reading this book...

looking forward for the third book in the Clifton saga




                                Jeffrey Archer has always been my favorite and yeah I have all his books. Read them all in these 2 decades of my life. Truly a page turner and I stuck like a leech till the end. Archer is brilliant as always and I really wish he would write faster.                            

                                Not one of Archer's best i feel, but it still has a quality to it that makes you turn that page just one more time. the plot is captivating in a combination of thrill and suspense and is worthy of attention.If you love Archer, then go for it.                            

                                I just finished reading Sins of the father, it was worth every penny and time I spent on it. 

This is the first time I have read any novel written by Jeffery Archer and I have become a fan of his writing.....
I cudnt stop after I started reading Only time will tell....

I am waiting for the next volumes......sooner the better!!!!                            

                                Again, Great delivery service from Flipkart. Nowadays I don't even check elsewhere for better prices. The tension free delivery makes up for the sometimes higher prices here.

Coming to the book:
Firstly, read "Avishek Banerjee"'s review on flipkart. I agree with him 100%. Over and above that, below is my review.
Great story. Good page turner. I would read in the morning on the way to work. And sometimes in the middle of the day I would be "I wonder what happened to Maise Clifton?"

Must read sequel to the previous book "Only time will tell".
Unfortunately, unlike last time the feeling of "When the next book will come?" is not there as much. I wish it finished off, I don't want to wait for another book!?

Yes, this is book 2 in what might be a series of 5 books.
Yup, Harry Potter set a trend here. All authors are catching up to the series idea. Get one good protagonist and drag the story for years.

Print Quality:
Average paper. Decent font size (not too small, good enough).
Good binding.

Jefferey Archer:
If you like any of his other books, you will like this for sure.

Cost (Value for Money):
Newly written, reasonably warm off the press (not hot! been in the market a few months.)
Good price for a reasonably new book. (I took into account print quality).
Book out May 2012, I paid Appx 250 in August, not bad.

Finally:
Is this book supposed to be Tasted/Swallowed/Digested:
Swallowed.
You can't miss stuff in the book, you need to read it thoroughly. Ask yourself the occasional question "What would I have done?".

"Some books are meant to be tasted, others to be swallowed,
and some few to be chewed and digested;
That is, some books are to be read only in parts; Others to be read, but not curiously; And some few to be read wholly, and with dilligence and attention."
-Francis Bacon, Of Studies                             

                                The Sins of the Father is the second in his five-book Clifton Chronicles saga by the master story teller "Jeffrey Archer".
As an Archer fan, I had loved the first one and I loved this one as well.
Brilliant is the word!                            

                                I am buying this just because of inertia. But story is stale, no new concept, feels like a mixture of all good jeffrey archer novels, specially reminiscent of "Kane and abel" and "Sons of fortune" and similar UK-American stuff during world wars. But still pleasant to read.                             

                                Only time will tell ,,, that Sins of The father will create how much mysteries ! awesome novel awesome series,,, cant wait for another edition,,,, nd flipkart thanks for delivering it on time ...for all those who love mysteries nd sudden changes than dis is definately for them . have fun reading it ,,,nd those who have already read ,,, to be contd for another edition . :-)                            

                                An amazing read esp after its prequel...will leave you high and dry, wanting more.... Waiting for the "Best Kept Secrets" to be out in March 2013...
Also loved the efficiency with which I gt the book delivered and that too on just 2 days. I had this book with me even before I had finished reading its prequel.



                                Jeffery Archer again made an excellent book.This book's story is plot during the time of world war,when a person named harry gets an offer from a guy who's son killed his other son(brother) and he will pay him ten thousand dollars if he appeals as his son(the killer),but harry,the innocent thinks and accepts his offer.he guarantees that they will win the case and he will not go to jail,but it was all his plot in terms to save his son from jail and harry goes to jail unnecessarily.he encounters a lot of problem till his girl from Britain receives his letter about his life before going to jail.the girl in order to find harry visits America and then the story goes on.
I would say that this book is easy to read and value for money                                

                                thank you flipkart for providing the delivery within 2 days and the book is just engaging as its other novels from jeffrey archer. i have not yet finished it but i think in 2 more days i will be finishing it and looking for some more books from him                            

                                After reading Clifton chronicles 1, I was waiting for this second part.  I am an Archer fan and he doesn't disappoint us.
Clifton's nature of birth or paternity is full of suspense, even in this edition and is carried forward to the next edition too!



                                The sins of Father is a great masterpiece from Jeffry Archer.It is the continuation of Only Time will tell.I received it with a good packing within 2days.Thanks to flipkart for their greatest service.Its a good thing to read this novel.You dont even think to put down this book once you started reading.Jeffry Archer takes the path of story such a way there is something interesting in each page.Over all I'm loving this one very much.I will give 5/5.                            

                                An excellent story which keeps the reader hooked to the book.The story flows very smoothly. The characters are not shown as fictional heros but very simple, humble and courageous personalities. The writing language is appreciative. It has enough of everything to be transformed into a film. Many time it becomes difficult to remember that the work is of a fiction and not a real story. Probably justifies why Jeffrey is said to be the best story teller.

Advise to all book lovers to read it atleast once........                            

                                I felt this book was a more interesting read than the first one. And a real page turner at that. In the end, I kinda cursed Archer for not ending the story here (and happy there's more like this to read). Overall, a very good read. Solid fun.                            

                                Page turner till the end, but there is no story.
There is not enough life, he has created a pale life form.
Not enough energy, the skeletal structure is good but not enough flesh nor blood.
Why is it still a page turner till the end? its because the author knows how to tell a story even when it makes up none till the end.
British and their idiosyncrasies, their nonsensical superficiality, kookiness, eccentricity  the the last 50 pages is all about this and the very story is based on this. 


                                The book will appeal to Jeffrey Archer fans as it is written in his typical style. I was disappointed with the end though, seems like Archer must have already planned a sequel. 
As always, Flipkart delivered the book in two days & the packaging was excellent. Keep up the good work!                            

                                Jeffery Archer does another of his master strokes.This time the story revolves around the world war and how all the characters are placed w.r.t it.
Arhtur,Giles,Hugo,Maisie and Emma literally come to life through  this epic.
This time Archer goes to Africa and comes back to Europe and as usual the perfectionist rises to occasion.
Every minute thing is detailed to perfection.



                                Another best seller from archer. i started to read this one without knowing that it's 2nd part of the Clifton chronicles.How ever it is engrossing and thrilling to read and leaves the reader with a want to look forward to its next part.You will develop an attachment towards the character EMMA and wish that she gets married to Harry in this book. But it appears readers has to wait for an year more.                             

                                The book picks up precisely where the first ended and is rather nicely gelled with its predecessor. As is usual with Archer's novels, its written in the classic style of his other drama narrations, fast paced, extremely absorbing, overall thoroughly enjoyable. Particularly like the chemistry of the main protagonists. 
However, i have a complain. I noticed that the paper quality of the novel was not of the highest quality, certainly not the same as the previous novel. I know its not flipkart's issue but that of the publisher. Wonder why it so.  
Flipkart's delivery is always aweosme.                            

                                Okay well, The Sins Of The Father, Jeffrey Archer! 

To begin with, this was my first Jeffrey Archer novel! And now, i am certain there would be lot more novels of this esteemed writer in my shelf! 

The coverpage, the story, the characters! All felt so real as I read this novel. So intriguing a piece of work. Those who have not yet read this one and are reading this review, I highly recommend you this one, honestly! When you ultimately finish it, you'd be so glad you gave your time to it! :) 

Thank you so much Jeffrey!                             

                                The clifton chronicles does not match up to the hype. The story lacks depth of "as the crow flies' or the intrigue of "Kane and Abel" or even the deception of "First among equals". This is story that is superficial, largely concoted with convenient episodes and surely a sign of a master in wane. Adios Archer!!!                            

                                The first book in series was a delightful read. For me the most important character in 'Only time will tell' was Old Jack. Unfortunately we do't have Old Jack in this one. What we have is old wine in new bottle. Though Harry's story moves forward at a very good pace and WW-II has been interwoven in the plot fabulously but throughout the book I was able to predict what is going to happen next. It might be because I had just recently read 'A Prisoner of Birth', which happens to be about the struggle of an innocent convict by the same author. I also found the stories of both Giles' and Harry's escape from Germans a bit over the top (and coincidentally in both cases their friends met death just before they were about to escape). Moreover the characters are uni-dimensional - a character is either extremely lovable or is totally loathsome. There are no conflicts apart from the one related to the true heir of Barrington legacy. All in all a decent book (there is never a dull moment). But I was expecting much more than this in the second instalment of Harry Clifton saga.                            

                                Was eagerly waiting for this book from Jeffrey Archer. He is the in my books the best writer in playing with the readers brain , a quality that many writers this day dont possessed. Hope he delivers many more hits like this. Thank you Flipkart for the delivery in 2 business days as promised. you guys rock ;-)                            

                                If you have read the first installment in the Clifton Chronicles then you will find the sequel even more enticing and enjoyable.
One thing that makes this novel superb is the fact that each and every character in the novel is given equal importance and plays equally important role like that of the protaganist Harry Cliffton in taking the story further.....you wont find it dragging at any point as many novels with sequels tend to be. If you are an avid reader you got to have this on your book shelf.                            

                                This book is Vintage ARCHER. The only thing the reaader has to keep in mind is that he/she should have read the prequel to this book Only time will tell, otherwise the reader wont be able to make out how harry clifton got to america and who the beautiful emma barrington was and how bad a man hugo barrington could be. All in all its and amazing tale of twists and turns and the beautiful relation emma shares with harry. u almost feel sorry for emme when she learns that harry has gone to war from the US itself but at the same time u share her joy when she learns that he is still alive.
a very good book but u shud also have the prequel at hand.                            

                                Who can write better than Jeffrey Archer? This book is an absolute page turner. Mr. Archer is too good in setting the characters. You feel the entire narration being played just in front of your eyes. I do not want to say much about the plot because YOU need to buy this and read. One big problem with Archer is that he somehow manages you to desperately wait for the next book of the Clifton saga.                            

                                i ordered it just because i was getting an author signed copy....
but seriously its awesome but before buying it do not forgot that it's a second part of only time will tell.....
so order that one before/.....................                            

                                Sins of Father is the another good book of Jeffrey Archer.
we have to read at least one time otherwise you will miss forever.
Story of Harry Clifton and Emma is lovable and Jeffery Archer is used idea like his another novels                            

                                Kept me hooked tilled the last page hoping to know the weather Harry would marry Emma.. 

The world war story was very dramatic written with every point proving more and more interesting

Eagerly waiting for next series of suspends to unlock,,,

Amazing storyline Thanks a lot Mr. Archer..                            

                                My second book by the author and I loved it! I just read Kane and Abel before this one.
However, the quality of the book itself was not up to my expectations. The pages are low quality and the print quality does not look as crisp as it could. The back cover said that it was to be sold only in the Indian subcontinent, which may explain the low quality.
The novel is really good, btw. Recommended read.                            

                                After completing the first book "Only Time Will Tell" I was happy to know that the sequel is in the stands already. I didn't have to wait. But now that I am done reading the second, I am waiting desperately for the next installment of the book to come so that we are able to find out what happens next. 

I mainly have to talk about the characters:-
This one continues on the lines where the first left and the characters grow and the lesser known characters come on their own in this book. The twists and the turns are wonderful and every character is so wonderfully crafted. Even the small characters that make a small entry and exit leaves their mark in your mind (and heart). Specially "Bates" for me. As we read we just hope that - "this is what should happen, PLEASE GOD!!" and at times it does and most of the times it doesn't :-( 

So all those who havent read the first please read that and come here and read this. Excellent book. 

Pradeep                             

                                Wish the saga had ended with this book... but the wait continues..

When I bought this book, did not realise that it had a 1st part, but what can I say... the master that Archer is, he does not allow the reader, for a momment, to feel, that the 1st part should be read before.

The pace is good, characters are well etched, though must admit that it is not as fast paced as the other books. 

Definately worth buying and reading the Clifton Saga                            

                                THE SINS OF THE FATHER,which is  sequel to ONLY TIME WILL TELL, is a page turner with various twists & turns in the story.

A book that holds you from the very first line and does not allow you to quit until the very last page is turned. 

The Cliffton Chronicles is getting more interesting...............
Can't wait for the next part. Just hope it will be available soon.                            

                                I have not gone through the prequel of this book "Only Time Will Tell", however this one is addictive too! Mr. Archer's way of story telling is simple and brilliant. Most of  the characters are closed to the heart especially Harry, Emma, Giles, Quinn and Bates. Masterpiece!! Looking forward for the sequel. Thanks a lot Mr. Archer.                             

                                This book and clifton saga reminded me of a popular soap (one tree hill) as i went through in the initial chapters and in the latter half of a Indian movie. So if I mix a daily soap on English channel and a Bollywood movie it gives me a cocktail which is definitely different, pleasant or not depends on the taste of the reader. 
Personally I was predicting everything a chapter in advance so only exciting part for me was Jeffery archer's unique story telling way. I have reluctantly purchased the next edition as well but only time will tell whether I would be interested in the saga for long.                            

                                Since this is part 2 of a trilogy, an obvious must read for those who read "Only Time Will Tell". For those looking for a British WW II era socio political thriller, a nice initiation into Jeffrey Archer but do start with part 1.                            

                                I was awaiting for this volume after reading Only Time Will Tell.. and I must say the previous part was better in term of the grip of the story.. This one is also good butthe story looses steam after a certain point.. If you have read Kane and Abel, The Prisoner of the Birth and other novels by the same author.. you'll be able to guess what's coming next...
Jeffrey Archer has this remarkable capability to create the early 1900s and world War 2 times so intersting that you'll almost feel if your are living the same time...
Much more enjoyable if you have not read his earlier novel already... Such are the benchmarks set by this author..!
Hoping for a better third part...!                            

                                Brilliantly written book. Jeffrey Archer has outdone himself in presenting a book which is engrossing to the tee. Impeccably written book which doesnt let the reader go off the hook for even a second. Perfect material for a big screen adaptation. Must buy for all lovers of thrillers and Archerians!                            

                                The second book in the Clifton Chronicles proves as engaging as the first one. A fast, gripping read, it has all the qualities that a typical Jeffrey Archer novel has - lucid writing style, unexpected twists and the ability to make you feel that you know the characters personally. Gets a bit predicatable at points, especially if you have been a regular reader of Archer novels, but that does not take away much from the experience. The only drawback is that you need to wait almost a year to figure out what happens next!

One piece of advice - unless you have a great memory, it may make sense to revisit the first book (Only Time Will Tell) before starting this one.                            

                                Another masterpiece from Archer. Harry Clifton continues to hold our attention as does all the other characters, The story line is nothing spectacular but it unfolds slowly and will keep you on the edge. Harry's presence of mind in clinching a victory for the Allies is impressive though not entirely practical. The story apart, the immaculate English and the simple yet powerful expressions gives a feeling of smooth sailing. Immensely beneficial for young writers. The story however leaves us in the lurch once again. Mr Archer, can we expect another sequel soon?                            

                                Without a doubt, the author's best work till date. I just couldn't put this one down. A book that sucks you in from the very first line and does not allow you to breathe until the last page is turned. It was my bad luck that I ordered it on the day before my exam.

I'll still say that it was worth it!

On the heels of the international bestseller Only Time Will Tell, Jeffrey Archer picks up the sweeping story of the Clifton Chronicles.

The story takes off exactly where it had left us in Only Time Will Tell, with Harry being questioned by the police inspector after being arrested because he was impersonating Tom Bradshaw. In typical Archer style, it progresses quickly through various characters, frequently going back and forth in time. 

The ending, as expected, was completely unexpected. And abrupt. A cliffhanger that left me groaning when I turned the last page. I am buying the next in the series as soon as it hits the bookstores.

Oh, and btw awesome job delivering the books flipkart....                            

                                Thanks to flipkart for making my experience of shopping online, a great one. I'm not new to online shopping and have shopped online for almost everything. But the experience with flipkart, has been fantastic.

I just chanced upon this book while surfing through flipkart. I had read the first part, Only Time Will Tell, but was a bit disappointed with the ending as I found it quite abrupt. But the moment, I saw that this is the sequel to it, I went ahead and bought it. Its a good read!                            

                                As usual, superb book from Archer. Since Flipkart had a 2-3 business day shipping time, I went to local bookstore (Sapna in Bangalore) and got it for 260/-. Except for couple of chapters where Maisie Clifton gets in touch with an American Major from North Carolina (for no apparent connection in the story line!), rest of the book was so good that I finished it in one sitting. And for good measure, went back and re-read the first part as well.                            

                                I have been an ardent fan of Jeffrey Archer and do not think twice before pre-ordering his latest novels. But The Sins of the Father, second book of a proposed trilogy, has left me disappointed. It is almost like a jigsaw puzzle solved and presented to you. No twist and turn, just so very predictable. Has Jeffrey Archer lost his magic touch?                            

                                Nice book. I am very much impressed with it. Provide a relevant, unbiased overview of the product. Readers are interested in the pros and the cons of the product. Provide a relevant, unbiased overview of the product. Readers are interested in the pros and the cons of the product.                             

                                I have just one word for this book "Unputdownable"
Jeffrey Archer is certainly a masterclass and he shows it with aplomb in this second book of "The Clifton Chronicals"
Eagerly awaiting the next one :)



                                This is really a great book. Its nice and it creates excitement.  After a very long time I am reading a good book.  As we start reading its like we need to find out whats the end.  A very good book and must read. Please read the first version before reading it otherwise you will not understand lot of ends.                            

                                The high priest of fiction does it yet again. He has proven for the nth time why he is still the best. I liked this book even better than the last one. Reminded me of his masterpiece, Kane and Abel. I read it at breath neck speed. It is a pity that we may have to wait for over a year maybe for the next book, don't know how I will wait.                            

                                There is no doubt that Jeffrey Archer is a master story teller and he has proved it once again. The book though starts slowly and unlike the tempo at which the first part 'Only Time Will Tell' ends, it is more of shock.

Harry is caught in a murder case as he took on the name of Tom Bradshaw. Unlike him, he is easily fooled by the lawyer jelks and ends up in jail. From there the book picks up and keeps the pace.

In the meanwhile back in England, everyone except Emma think that he is dead. And everyone except Hugo mourns. The book is on the same pattern as the first one and after a few pages picks up well and except for some parts, looks very interesting. The part where Harry fools the entire german regiment, seems far-fetched and unnecessary for the plot.

The book ends on a high and leaves you wanting to know what happened next for which we will need to wait for some months :)                            

                                I consider myself to be one of the biggest fans of Mr. Archer. Still The Sins of the Father disappointed me.

In his haste to write a 5 book series, he seems to have forgotten writing a story to fill 5 books. The plot moves on slowly and the book lacks the magnetism of Only Time Will Tell. The writing is top notch but the pacing is very stalling and I felt bored for some parts of it.

TSOTF is by no means a bad book. It just isn't good enough.                            

                                It was a long wait for the second book in the series, and it doesn't disappoint. Story of Emma, Giles & Harry move forward at a really quick pace. The stories of other characters is also very convincingly told but it ends with us wondering what to expect from the third in the series, probably the stories of the next generation..                            

                                The book is awesome! There is not a single boring page and towards the end you will want to read a bit slowly, not because the book gets boring but because iyou won't want it to end.....
I have only one problem.....Mr. Archer should have better started writing the next book as this one too ends in a cliff hanger!!                            

                                This eagerly awaited volume 2 of clifton chronicles was an excellent read with all the archer twists and turns...felt like its almost over...but then we know its Jeffery archer...so dont mind waiting for the next one..:)                            

                                First of all, thanks to flipkart for delivering my order within 24 hrs.. Ur service is extraordinary.. 

Coming to THE SINS OF THE FATHER,which is a sequel to ONLY TIME WILL TELL, is a page turner which should have ended merrily after various twists & turns in this book. I dont know how Jeffery Archer is going to take the next part since the book seemed to be nearing completion in this edition itself. But Jeffery Archer is a master story-teller and has a proven track record in his kitty. 

The story simply takes off from where it was left in the previous book. Tom Bradshaw(Harry Clifton) is arrested for the murder of his own brother but gets a prison term not for murder but only for desertion of US Navy. The mistaken identity is never proved in court and the story moves on in non-linear narration with other important characters of the story. This story is all about whether Harry is found to be alive by Emma and What happens to Giles, Maisie & Hugo after Harry leaves Bristol. The new characters add spice to the story and make us finish the book in one read. Though there are many logical loopholes in the book, one can never question them since the story was happening in 1940s when there was not much scientific advancements. 

Awaiting eagerly for the next part of the Clifton Chronicles :)                            

                                If there's one writer who could make you fall in love with his characters its Jeffrey Archer, and when I say love, its actually love :)

At the end of Only Time Will Tell, you start developing an attachment to Emma Barrington. And the end of The Sins of the Father, you wish she was your lover. And this feeling is not just restricted to Emma. As every character of Mr. Archer unfolds and matures itself from the first book to the end of the current one, you wish that you could meet them in real life. Be it the ever deprived mother Masie Clifton, the loveable Great Aunt Phyllis, the grand fatherly Sir Barrington and Lord Harvey or the ever so devilish Hugo Barrington. You would end up developing intense feelings for each one of them. And the star of all is of course is Sir Harry (now) - Archer makes you wish you were him. The character whole lot of not so good times, but by the end of it all, there are good times waiting, good times that are brought about by the girl for whom he was bearing with all the not so good times. Top all this love with the pains and misfortunes of war. If anyone tries to finish off this book in one sitting, then one thing is guaranteed for sure - they would have time travelled to Second World War America and Europe - that's the effect of Mr. Archer on you.

But, I just have one regret. I really wanted to see the most anticipated marriage of Clifton Chronicles getting done and over in this book - Harry weds Emma. But I guess we all would have to wait a year more :(                             

                                Amazing Storyline..... Sir Archer had made a masterpiece for all ages, One cannot leave the book until encounters the back page. The Story Starts from The Cliffton arrest where It had concluded in the last part of Cliffton Chronicles(Only Time Will Tell), and since then there's no backward, one will keep reading the sagas of Barrington and Clifftom with equal excitement...Emma's character stated the great enthusiasm and powerful performance of the writer's PEn on her character. Now waiting for the next part....                            

                                Simply superb.....just could'nt put the books down. I wish there
is a third volume.  Harry Clifton is a gentleman and Emma Barrington? Cannot say enough about her. Strongly recommend these Clifton Chronicles.                            

                                I was anxiously waiting for this part to be released after its first part 'only time will tell'. Archer continued the same pace and the momentum going in his unique way. I enjoyed every page of it thorougly, Now my wait already started for the next part.I prebooked this book from flipkart, as usual they delivered bang on time.                            

                                This book does not have the same gripping experience as many of the other J Archer books. 

The end is absurd to say the least and the build up to the climax gets too predictable unlike J Archer's other novels. May be I understand him too much now or this one is not unto the mark in build up.                            

                                The purchase of this book was my first transaction with Flipkart, and so I was a little skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received the extremely well packaged book within 36 hours of placing the order! Not only did I get a hefty discount on the cover price, but also I was saved and spared from my time, energy and the transport cost of making a trip to my nearest book-store. Kudos to Flipkart! Thank you and please carry on with the good work that you are doing. 

This book, which is the 2nd part of the 5 parts of the Clifton chronicles, starts from where it left off in the earlier book, âOnly Time Will Tellâ(2011), with Harry Clifton being arrested in the U.S. on charge of murder, when he takes the identity of his dead ship mate, Tom Bradshaw.  He gets a 6 year jail sentence, thanks to the machinations of a crafty and wily lawyer, Sefton Jelks. The book primarily deals with Harryâs experiences in prison, his subsequent release and his exploits in the 2nd World War.

In a parallel mode, the book also chronicles the tireless efforts of Harryâs love interest, Emma Barrington, in trying to trace him down in America. The book also follows the fortunes of Harryâs mother Maisie, his childhood buddy, Giles Barrington and his illegitimate father (?) Hugo Barrington.

Although this book is not in the same league as Archerâs previous Kane & Abel trilogy, it is however engrossing and interesting to read, though the plot seems somewhat predictable. Archer, however, saves his best for the last, when he ends on a tantalizing note, making the readers of this saga wait for another year to know whether Harry or Giles will get the peerage, or whether Harry will be able to marry his childhood sweet-heart Emma after all!

With soothsayers making prophecies and doomsday predictions about the end of the world in 2012, I hope we all will remain alive and hale and hearty to read the next 3 installments of the story in 2013-2015.



                                Jeffrey Archer yet again weaves out a magical story for us to sit back and enjoy. His trademark style of impersonating is yet again proven in his latest bestseller in the form of young  Clifton.Do buy it if you are a fan of quality fiction and obviously if you are an Archer fan.                            

                                The book is  Bollywood style . It only goes to say that the  subcontinent version is most suitable for this region only . How could Jeffrey Archer do this to us ? Absolutely disappointing . Ever heard an full Nazi Armourd Coprs  falling to the bluff of a junior army officer .                              

                                OMG! i wish Archer could publisha ll the books @ one go as he keeps me more and more impatient with the next book. Only time will tell proved itself and The sins of the father is just another feather in his cap. He knows weel to keep the twists and turns up till the end and give a perfect start to his next one. The book will give you more anticpation and few answers and definitely an epic. I bet it would be the next in the line after Harry potter series the keeps the readers waiting for the next book. Amust read for all!                            

                                The book is really amazing, definitely a page turner. It keeps you guessing till the last page and makes you wishing for more and more but the truth is, you will never get enough - well that's the speciality of Mr. Archer.

I am eagerly waiting for the next part to come, i just hope one year passes in a jiffy.

A piece of advice to people who haven't read this or Only Time Will Tell, PLEASE READ IT. You are really missing on something brilliant. 
Every page is WORTH IT.                            

                                Nice work by the auther, till you reach the last chapter of the book! It suddenly seems like the story has lost it's pace! If you read it, do skip the climax 'cause it kinda killed all my fun of reading the story!                            

                                The book was in line with the expectations and author kept good pace throughout the book,although towards the end it was a bit exaggerated but last few pages leaves you asking for more.
A must read for fiction lover but make sure you must read "Only time will tell" before reading this one. Cheers!!!



                                Archer starts exactly from where he left previously and leaves you yet again in suspense. Well written and the story moves at a good pace. Could see the flashes of his "Prisoner of Birth" novel in the Prison part of the story. His description about the war is as brilliant as they were in his earlier novels.   



                                What first came to my mind when I read the novel was that it would make a great movie. The second part of the Clifton Chronicles reinforces that impression. 

The consequences of the affairs one has in the youth and the potential for incest which it creates has been woven seamlessly into the story by Archer. The suspense in that regard which was the main issue in the first book has not abated even in this one. 

It is a layered story. At one level, it shows the struggle of people to get ahead of life in spite of class prejudices and the depths to which some others would stoop to preserve the class hierarchy. At another level, it is the tale of personal valor and selflessness. 

This is a must read.                            

                                The plot continues as Harry Clifton faces life challenging trials to protect love. The lovely creation takes us on a journey full of   love and war, of friendship and of deceit, as the characters go through heaven and hell to protect secrets.Mr Archer has made sure we are waiting for more as he beautifully unravels the plot to a climax which will begin in the forthcoming book in the clifton Chronicles series.

A must read for all.                            

                                Worth every second of the waiting and every penny paid for.  Archer's art of story telling continues as of describing life's characters. The only part which made me sad was that archer killing both the buddies of harry and giles that too at the point of returning home.                            

                                i liked the book very much.. it is written beautifully.. tho i didn't find it as fast-paced and hooking as the first book.. and i feel like the ending could've bin better.. milking the story for all its worth is wat i think the ending is.. ending on a good note.. i loved that giles was given more importance in this book and i loved the book... must read for everyone!

P.S: flipkart is the best way to get your books without hassle!                            

                                Though I am yet to finish the book and would not reveal the plot but the sequel to Only Time Will Tell is amazing...Clifton's life after accident is explored with Emma coming to US...
Though Only Time Will Tell was more intense and suspense...                            

                                The second book in the series of the Clifton Chronicles does not disappoint . It has masterly writing as we come to expect from Archer and it moves on at a fast pace . There is a comparison between Clifton in jail and Archer with the writing of diaries . This is something you will not put down until you finish it                              

                                Sins of my father ,the second part of Only Time Will Tell,takes the readers to a new level where one sees a lots of things going on in the life of Barringtons and the Cliftons.The story continues from where Harry gets arrested by American cops on the docs on pretence of Tom Bradshaw .Then starts the weaving of another masterpeice which leaves the readers turning pages till the point when one encounters the back cover.

Amazing masterpiece from an Sir Jefferey Archer and a must read for every Jeff Arch fan.

P.S. I pre-ordered this book from flipkart as I was eagerly waiting for this after I have read the first part which by coincidence I ordered from flipkart exactly a year mack on March 2011.



                                This story is in continuous of "Only Time will tell" .As expecetd book is awesome with full of twists and so many new chracters.Story is not ended in this book and I am waiting for the next series.

The way Jeferry narrated the life of Harry in Jail and how Emma find our Harry is very nice.                             

                                When i finished Archer's "Only Time will Tell", I was becoming restless for the sequel to come out. And when it came, i realized... the wait was worth the every minute of the day.. However, there are some parts which needs to complete the story..Like - what happened to the two proposals of Masie she was contemplating and what were the circumstances that made her to marry her teacher. 

Also, who was the party who bought the property for which Hugo paid 1000 pounds to Masie..

Overall, a very gripping story.

Looking forward to the next sequel.



                                A fitting sequel to 'Only Time will Tell'. Archer continues in the same vein as he has done over the last several decades, keeping the reader completely engrossed in the story till the end. All the characters come to life as the story keeps shuttling from one place to another and all the individual experiences eventually come together to a glorious climax, yet leave you with a feeling of wanting more.                            

                                From the get go, this book has been amazing!!! The depiction of prison life once again, SPELLBOUNDING!!! Emma and Giles have a major part, which has been much more bigger than Harry's and Hugo is still the same nutcase, after all the humiliation he faced in the previous book. All in all, a great book. Can't wait for Book 3 of 5 in this series.                            

                                it is a good book or you can say quite a typical book as expected from the author with the prison saga continuing. however the style presented by describing the story in parts with respect to each character was defining. also the cohesion so as to whose story comes next keeps the reader gripped on to the book.
an enthralling style and a gripping story indeed. 
and this was my first experience reading a book in pre-released state. only flipkart could provide such opportunity!                            

                                The second book in the Cliffton Chronicles was as good as the first. Got it on the first day itself and the story is far too good. Only issue with reading the book as soon as its released is that you will have to wait longer for the next part to get released..... A MASTER PEICE.                            

                                Got it on the day of it's release. Flipkart rocks in that regard. The book was excellent right from the start till the end. I finished it much sooner than usual. Now I am a fan of Jeffrey Archer. Waiting for the 3rd book.                            

                                I would'nt say this book/series as must THE BEST,but this series so far has not let me down as an ardent Jeffrey Archer fan.Their is lot to praise the author in this part especially the way he takes us to an era where 2nd world war took place and depicted the scenarios which might float in front of ur eyes, as u read.The story for me was neither boring and neither made me sit on the edge of the chair but it sure is an page turner.
You'll surely understand what i have quoted once you start reading the book.This book is fitting sequel to the Only Time Will Tell.
Waiting for the Sequel , only wondering what Harry wud be doing next?                            

                                Reading The Sins of the Father was a feeling of complete ecstasy. It's a sequel of the book "Only Time will tell." Everyone who are even a bit interested in reading novels should read this very book. The story starts from the arrest of Harry Clifton and builds up referring to all the other characters mentioned in the first part of Clifton Chronicle (Only Time will Tell). It's difficult to put down this book once you start with it. The only problem with it is the story doesn't even ends in this part which I was eagerly waiting for. But the adventure & mesmerizing essence of this book has overtly overshadowed that. This book is one among the finest works of Jeffry Archer.                            

                                When I read the first book I was disappointed because it has only problems and no solutions but the second part is fantastic and I couldn't put down the book until the last page. The book was fast and never slowed down its pace and it's really hard to wait for the next episode. Brilliant and energetic writing added one more feather to Archer's hat.                              

                                I really loved the book, especially Harry and Giles parts. Archer writes very well and unfortunately leaves this book again on a cliffhanger.Nevertheless, it is a must read for everyone who like the Archer style of storytelling. POW camp and WW2 fight scenes are too good...Hopefully the next book will come soon

                                Got the delivery on the morning the book was released. Nice flow, interesting story-line, it still hangs by the edge when i reached the last page(i reached there fairly quick).

And seriously you can't, when you have reached the last page of this book, guess what could or would happen next! 
To sum it up! Worth every penny.
VERDICT: Could you, Mr. Archer, write faster?                             

                                I was eagerly waiting for the second installment of the Clifton Chronicles. Pre-ordered it on Flipkart and was promptly delivered in 2 days after its release. The book was nicely packaged too. 
The book just flows and before you know, it's over and leaves you wanting more. Jeffrey Archer is one of the best storytellers of our age.

                                Lives up to the anticipation. 
Jeffery has given a little cinematic feel to it, which suits a lot to the book.
Read it all in two days and I am already waiting for the next one.

                                Jeffrey continues to surprise his readers with his typical twists and turns. He answers all his critics who felt Only Time Will Tell ended on an abrupt note. Picking his readers from where he left Archer takes them on an entertaining roller coaster ride making sure they retain their hunger to reach the last page. The book is well crafted with skillfully written plot and characters. When you reach the last page you will only be disappointed to have to wait for another long year before you put your hands on the next book in series! A must read for all.                            

                                I just could not put this one down, but being by Jeffery Archer, no surprise there, he has this knack of getting his readers in the palm of his hand from the very first page, well worth the read fabulous, thoroughly enjoyed it , a must have !!!!!                            

                                When I started reading "Only Time Will Tell", the pages turned very slowly at first and finally it turned out to be a great experience. But this sequel, I couldn't keep it down for even once... Went all the way from front to back in 8 hours at a stretch... Really can't wait for the last and final book to be released. Lord Archer, RESPECT.                            

                                When I read the first book of the Cliftons Chronicle, I was a tad disappointed and restless as it left so many questions unanswered. With the second book, Archer successfully ups the ante and leaves you with even more suspense than the first book, only this time, the reader awaits in anticipation. The characters are etched out reasonably well but I had the feeling that he could have perhaps spent some more time in bringing out the emotional turmoil of the characters. Nevertheless, it is a typically good book from him; not in the same league as Honor Among Thieves, Kane and Abel but a preferred companion over the weekend all the same.                            

                                This book continues the story of harry clifton. For people who have not read "Only Time Will Tell" please pick that up first before buying this one.The storytelling,while not in the class of say Kane and Abel is sill mind blowing and the book is next to impossible to put down once you start reading.

All in all, a must read for any archer fan.                            

                                As the title suggests the book revolves largely around what happens to Harry Clifton who enters the USA in the name of Tom Bradshaw. The story finally ends up in a suspense note whether Harry was the son of Sir Hugo or not and who has to be the legal hire to the Title and property of the Barrington's after the death of Sir Hugo Barrington.

In this book Jeffrey Archer gave equal importance to all the Characters except for Grace Barrington who was mentioned quite a few times in the whole novel.                            

                                Archer delivers another page-turning, heart-stopping saga, with delightful twists, and a surprise endingâ¦.....I've read so much fiction in my life that only pretty good writing will hold my interest. This is high quality writing with quite good characterization.                            

                                The second book of Jeffrey Archer's most ambitious work The Clifton Chronicles,The Sins of the Father is a must read for all.Starting from the point where it ended in Only Time Will Tell
this book is nothing less than a roller coaster ride with great twist and turn.Talk about cliffhanger endings man.......cant wait to have my hands on the third book.A great and a wonderful read.More secrets will be revealed and life changing decisions will be made as Harry Clifton has to survive under the title of a First class murderer!!!!!
